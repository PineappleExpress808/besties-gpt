https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=161.6s	161.6	 I'm doing great. You know, I got another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=165.0s	165.0	 While you were in Italy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=167.3s	167.3	 I went to the breeder that I got Akhi from and she had a three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=175.1s	175.1	 year old that was not really, you know, ever going to become a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=179.9s	179.9	 breeding dog or whatever. So I adopted the three year old. He
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=183.0s	183.0	 has a parasite. So he's been pooing everywhere, everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=186.5s	186.5	 That's great information for the call over the all over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=189.1s	189.1	 castle all over the castle. Fantastic. Liquid poop, by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=192.6s	192.6	 way. But we finally diagnosed it today. And he's going to the to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=196.7s	196.7	 the vet to get some liquids and to get the parasite expunged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=201.5s	201.5	 from his body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=203.3s	203.3	 Okay, thank you for that information. I don't know where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=209.2s	209.2	 you nobody cares. I asked you how you were doing. I thought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=212.1s	212.1	 you were just gonna say great. I didn't know we were gonna go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=214.2s	214.2	 straight to diarrhea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=215.8s	215.8	 We got a new dog to you did. It's also it's been kind of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=219.0s	219.0	 disaster. The kids were like that we found this like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=222.6s	222.6	 know, golden. That is really calm. You know, like, she's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=227.8s	227.8	 super low energy and calm. It's like perfect for us. I'm like, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=231.1s	231.1	 don't know. I think that's just like the puppy is kind of asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=234.0s	234.0	 You know, like it's gonna wake up. They're like, No, no, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=237.2s	237.2	 no, this is like a special dog. It's like really well behaved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=240.0s	240.0	 Or so anyway, we get it. Sure enough, like a week later, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=244.3s	244.3	 puppy wakes up. And she's eating everything in the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=247.5s	247.5	 destroying everything. It's been Yeah, so now we're with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=251.8s	251.8	 dog number two or three for you. It's dog to with the dog one was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=255.3s	255.3	 a rescue dog who's great. So dog number two is now getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=259.4s	259.4	 trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=260.9s	260.9	 David Sachs is with us, of course, the Ray man himself, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=263.9s	263.9	 related dog stories. I put all the girls to bed and then I hear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=267.5s	267.5	 screaming I get up I run outside literally the new bulldog who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=272.6s	272.6	 nine months old Maximus went on you know, one of his running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=276.4s	276.4	 fits. One of my daughters falls out of bed, gets like a bruise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=280.9s	280.9	 on her like lower back and she's wailing. The other daughter feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=285.0s	285.0	 terrible about it. And then the dog decides that he is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=288.6s	288.6	 projectile vomit everywhere all at the same time. You guys have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=292.6s	292.6	 had these moments where like, it's just complete utter chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=296.2s	296.2	 It's chaos. Chaos. It's chaos. It's cat dogs plus kids equals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=299.9s	299.9	 chaos. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=302.1s	302.1	 but would any of us have it any other way? I love the combo of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=305.4s	305.4	 dogs and kids. It's just the best. It's pretty great. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=308.4s	308.4	 really dogs are amazing. And kids especially when you bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=311.0s	311.0	 in a new dog or a puppy into the house. It's chaos, but it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=313.9s	313.9	 really beautiful chaos. Well, you know what I think also is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=316.8s	316.8	 like, think about how overrated everything in life is people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=320.0s	320.0	 like, oh my god, this place with the pasta in Italy, it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=322.2s	322.2	 greatest life changing thing. And all this movie was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=324.9s	324.9	 incredible. It's the best movie ever made. And it's never the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=328.4s	328.4	 best movie ever made or the best pasta. It's great or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=331.1s	331.1	 But I think kids and dogs are underrated. universally have as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=337.1s	337.1	 many kids as you can possibly biologically have and can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=340.4s	340.4	 economically afford is my one opinion. And the more dogs the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=345.6s	345.6	 better. I love dogs. Yeah. All right. I think we should start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=349.2s	349.2	 with the COVID cases because this is impacting everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=353.2s	353.2	 from the economy to people's decisions touching on people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=357.9s	357.9	 freedoms. And it's hard to know where to start here. But I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=361.7s	361.7	 facts are always a good place to start. Here in the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=364.7s	364.7	 States. We had gotten COVID cases, you know, to that 12,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=369.0s	369.0	 a day average. It was pretty amazing. And it looked like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=372.2s	372.2	 was gonna go straight down smooth sailing. And we had had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=375.6s	375.6	 deaths down and around. I saw some seven day averages, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=380.4s	380.4	 we were at 150 200. Now the weekends are kind of weird, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=385.3s	385.3	 terms of reporting, but the seven day average today is at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=388.8s	388.8	 248. In other words, it's been flat for a month when you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=393.4s	393.4	 this. This is according to the New York Times statistics and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=395.6s	395.6	 Google, you can search for Google and you'll find these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=398.2s	398.2	 have some great data that they'll just put right in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=401.1s	401.1	 search result. However, cases have gone from this 1215 K a day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=406.6s	406.6	 average, soaring in just 30 days to 62,000 a day and a seven day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=413.3s	413.3	 average of 40,000. So we're basically tripled the number of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=416.1s	416.1	 cases, cases trail traditionally debts by something in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=420.7s	420.7	 neighborhood of 10 days, I think I'm correct, Friedberg. So what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=425.7s	425.7	 do you think is actually going to happen here? We're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=428.9s	428.9	 get up to 10 100,000 200,000 cases a day, and maybe double
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=433.6s	433.6	 the number of deaths from the people who are not vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=436.4s	436.4	 Yeah, you know, the current logic on this is that there will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=440.9s	440.9	 be because of the number of people that are generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=444.1s	444.1	 infected and are spreading what is now an even more infectious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=448.0s	448.0	 variant of COVID. The people that are not vaccinated are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=452.9s	452.9	 starting to get it at a higher rate. And that's where the deaths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=455.4s	455.4	 are starting to come from. So yeah, we will see deaths climb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=460.4s	460.4	 And I think like we talked about last time, we're starting to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=462.9s	462.9	 even Gavin did an interview yesterday in California talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=465.6s	465.6	 about how, you know, there it's on the table that we may go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=469.5s	469.5	 to certain restrictions, behavioral restrictions, mask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=473.5s	473.5	 mandates, etc. So there's going to be a set of reactions. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=478.2s	478.2	 think as we talked about last time, we saw the market start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=480.9s	480.9	 react to the potential of that on Monday. And then very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=484.4s	484.4	 interestingly, kind of reverse course, Tuesday, and everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=487.2s	487.2	 came back when everyone was freaked out on Monday after they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=489.8s	489.8	 saw the weekend's data, which showed that cases are climbing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=492.3s	492.3	 like crazy in the US. But I think the conventional wisdom is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=495.5s	495.5	 not that many people are going to die. Therefore, we're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=497.9s	497.9	 going to see, you know, political leaders, force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=503.1s	503.1	 restrictions that are kind of going to damage the economy. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=506.3s	506.3	 we're going to start to walk what I think Israel is calling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=508.5s	508.5	 the golden line, which is balancing the economy with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=511.9s	511.9	 health of the citizenry. So, so, you know, we'll see, it's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=516.9s	516.9	 to come down to policy. But I think from a deaths perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=518.9s	518.9	 there will absolutely be a rise in deaths now as unvaccinated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=521.6s	521.6	 people are the going to be the bulk of those deaths. And, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=524.3s	524.3	 this thing is spreading again amongst people that haven't been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=526.3s	526.3	 vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=527.5s	527.5	 Well, and then sacks, this becomes now a great raw shock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=531.3s	531.3	 test of what do you see in this data and in this moment, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=537.6s	537.6	 it's a pandemic, as many people are saying now, I think this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=540.4s	540.4	 becoming the meme or the catchphrase, it's a pandemic of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=543.6s	543.6	 the unvaccinated. So people have chosen to opt into this pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=548.1s	548.1	 and then a group of us have chosen to not be part of it, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=550.9s	550.9	 were part of it, even as a vaccinated person, but you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=553.9s	553.9	 feeling great. You're back to 100%. So what do you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=558.9s	558.9	 should happen in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=562.1s	562.1	 closings or shutdowns, or mask mandates? What's your take on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=568.1s	568.1	 the pandemic of the unvaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=570.7s	570.7	 Well, I think we need to differentiate between public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=573.9s	573.9	 policy and private behavior. So, you know, after last week's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=577.8s	577.8	 episode, where I said, you know, Delta variants real, there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=580.8s	580.8	 gonna be huge spike in cases. Unfortunately, I thought we had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=584.3s	584.3	 this thing whipped, you know, a few weeks ago, now I think the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=587.2s	587.2	 data is showing something different. You know, everyone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=589.6s	589.6	 there's a lot of commenters saying, sacks, you've turned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=591.8s	591.8	 you've been blue pilled. No, it's, you know, I think there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=594.6s	594.6	 difference between acknowledging what's going on and then having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=597.5s	597.5	 the policy conversation around it. I think that the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=601.6s	601.6	 now from last year, I mean, there's a couple of things. One
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=604.1s	604.1	 is that we do have vaccines. So I think for most people getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=609.8s	609.8	 vaccinated, we'll take the worst risks off the table. The other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=613.3s	613.3	 is we know so much more about what works and what doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=615.9s	615.9	 work. And so lockdowns don't work if you know, if they ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=620.3s	620.3	 did, they they they they they we now know, looking at from what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=625.2s	625.2	 different states did last year, that they don't make a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=628.1s	628.1	 difference. There's no reason to go back to that policy. But also,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=631.6s	631.6	 I mean, I would even say on mass, it should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=634.0s	634.0	 right. Do we know that? I mean, is that I think so sure of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=637.3s	637.3	 Yeah, I think so. Because the thing that the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=641.4s	641.4	 planners never take into account is that private citizens are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=644.8s	644.8	 going to adjust their behavior in both directions. So in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=647.9s	647.9	 Florida, they didn't have mandates, but people who are at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=650.7s	650.7	 risk took, you know, extreme precautions, they would either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=653.7s	653.7	 lock themselves down or be very fastidious about wearing a high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=656.5s	656.5	 quality mask. By contrast, in California, we had the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=661.1s	661.1	 severe lockdowns, but they were never really feasible. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=664.3s	664.3	 there's 10 pages of exceptions, people didn't really abide by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=666.9s	666.9	 them. And then on top of it, you know, you have all these mass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=669.9s	669.9	 mandates. But if somebody wears like a sock loosely affixed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=674.6s	674.6	 their face, does that really protect them? You know, so, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=678.3s	678.3	 know, people, if they're, if they're not interested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=681.1s	681.1	 complying with these mandates, they do it in a halfhearted way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=683.5s	683.5	 I'm not convinced that the mandates work in the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=685.7s	685.7	 place. So the smart thing to do here is just to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=689.9s	689.9	 recommendations and let private citizens decide what their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=692.9s	692.9	 response is going to be. We know now so much more about the risks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=696.9s	696.9	 that we all face than we did a year ago. And so just let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=701.5s	701.5	 private citizens decide. I mean, I'd even say on vaccines, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=704.6s	704.6	 mean, look, I'm pro-vax, I don't really understand where the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=708.5s	708.5	 anti-vax people are coming from. But I'm kind of done wasting my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=712.0s	712.0	 breath trying to convince people to get vaccinated, you know, on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=715.4s	715.4	 this show, who don't want to get vaccinated, you know, if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=718.4s	718.4	 don't want to send those doses to the developing world, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=721.1s	721.1	 they're desperate for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=722.0s	722.0	 Let me ask you, Trimoth, do you do you agree with Sachs's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=724.9s	724.9	 position that listen, citizens are just going to have to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=727.2s	727.2	 their own decision here, leave everything open. And let's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=731.0s	731.0	 have the economy collapse again, and people, people are smart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=734.4s	734.4	 enough to make their own decision. And is this framing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=736.9s	736.9	 of this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, the correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=740.2s	740.2	 framing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=740.6s	740.6	 Wow, I'm really of two minds. There's there's the part of me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=743.7s	743.7	 that says that you have to give people the right to make their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=748.1s	748.1	 own decision. The problem is that in this specific case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=751.3s	751.3	 there's so much transmissibility. And as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=758.3s	758.3	 result of that, how this thing can mutate, that I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=762.5s	762.5	 public health has to take a priority over any individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=767.9s	767.9	 individual's rights in this very specific narrow, narrow case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=772.7s	772.7	 because the Delta variant is so transmission transmissible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=776.7s	776.7	 people are going to have to lose some freedoms is one of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=780.3s	780.3	 showing a vaccine card when you go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=783.6s	783.6	 a rain that you wouldn't need that if everybody was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=786.1s	786.1	 vaccinated, or you had to go through a lot of hoops to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=790.1s	790.1	 unvaccinated as an example. I mean, and the reason is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=794.3s	794.3	 the longer you allow this thing to float around in the Petri
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=797.7s	797.7	 dish of the unvaccinated, you're increasing everybody's risk. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=802.6s	802.6	 this is where I think individual freedoms as long as as a trample
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=806.3s	806.3	 on collective freedom, then I think live and let live. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=812.8s	812.8	 think on this specific issue, I think that it's it's it's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=821.2s	821.2	 basically a time function, where at a certain amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=824.8s	824.8	 time, you're going to have a variant that that is, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=829.2s	829.2	 basically will overcome all the vaccines we have will kill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=834.0s	834.0	 enormous numbers of people, including the vaccinated will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=836.7s	836.7	 literally shut the economy down. And that's a probabilistic event
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=840.4s	840.4	 now. And I don't like the fact that susceptible to that because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=844.9s	844.9	 of a bunch of people who frankly, aren't doing it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=847.3s	847.3	 medical or religious reasons. They're just watching Fox News
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=850.3s	850.3	 and just spouting off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=851.3s	851.3	 I agree that we're at risk there. But we're also at risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=853.6s	853.6	 from accident and vaccinated people in the rest of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=856.2s	856.2	 So Delta variant came from India, the lambda variant, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=860.0s	860.0	 think the wrong came from Peru. I mean, the fact that matter is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=863.0s	863.0	 unvaccinated people everywhere are potential Petri dish for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=866.1s	866.1	 virus. So I'd rather I mean, this is why we need to send
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=869.5s	869.5	 those unused doses that by the way, are at risk of expiring. We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=873.4s	873.4	 know I mean, there was a tweet about this recently, there's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=879.3s	879.3	 now. We should ship those anywhere in the world that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=881.6s	881.6	 people are ready to get back specifically to Mexico and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=891.3s	891.3	 the percentage vaccinated, let me ask it more pointedly, should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=894.4s	894.4	 a T should teachers be public school teachers be forced to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=897.4s	897.4	 vaccinated? Should you be forced to have a vaccine card to get on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=902.1s	902.1	 public transportation airplanes or, you know, take buses, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=906.2s	906.2	 know, long haul buses, long haul trains, and then third, should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=911.1s	911.1	 you be forced to show a vaccine card to get on to go to sporting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=917.1s	917.1	 events or concerts, let's go through those three. So your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=921.6s	921.6	 personal freedom ends, you're going to be forced if you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=925.7s	925.7	 go to group behaviors, if you want to participate in a public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=928.6s	928.6	 construct, if you want to consume a public resource, or if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=932.0s	932.0	 you want to provide a publicly funded good, then it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=936.8s	936.8	 broader public's rights that are superior to your individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=942.1s	942.1	 rights. Otherwise, work at a charter school where it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=944.9s	944.9	 required. Watch the fucking concert from home or drive your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=951.1s	951.1	 The end. What do you think? And then Freiburg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=953.8s	953.8	 So I understand that argument, I would differentiate between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=957.5s	957.5	 public and private requirements, because I don't like the idea of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=961.3s	961.3	 giving government the power to forcibly stick a needle in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=964.5s	964.5	 arm. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=966.9s	966.9	 what your mom said you could stay home where you could take your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=968.9s	968.9	 bicycle. Sure. So is that a reasonable that you don't get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=972.4s	972.4	 go to a Warriors game because you're unvaccinated? Yeah, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=975.1s	975.1	 think you know, the Warriors Stadium is privately owned, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=978.5s	978.5	 team is private. So I think that I think that private companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=982.1s	982.1	 should be able to set up their own rules for the benefit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=984.7s	984.7	 their employees and customers airlines, because that is, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=988.1s	988.1	 know, a gate, it's, there's a limited number of them. Yeah, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=992.2s	992.2	 think so. airline should be able to force it. Now, what about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=994.4s	994.4	 school teachers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=996.0s	996.0	 They can't force it, but they can set the requirements for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=998.5s	998.5	 to board their planes. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1000.4s	1000.4	 okay, now, what about public schools should, if let's do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1004.0s	1004.0	 teachers and students, should teachers be forced to get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1008.5s	1008.5	 vaccine if they want to come in? Because you said if they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1010.9s	1010.9	 come to work in the fall on a couple episodes back, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1013.2s	1013.2	 fired. Well, why wouldn't they want to get a vaccine? The whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1015.5s	1015.5	 debate with the teachers unions was that they wanted to be at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1018.1s	1018.1	 front of the line for vaccines, which isn't an issue anymore,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1020.3s	1020.3	 because we have so many. So I don't think that's a serious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1023.1s	1023.1	 issue. Now, requiring the kids to get vaccinated is that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1027.5s	1027.5	 would be the real policy question. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1029.9s	1029.9	 well, let's tackle both should teachers be forced to get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1033.6s	1033.6	 vaccine? Yes or no, you just kind of brushed over. Yeah, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1036.6s	1036.6	 felt forced. No, I mean, I think it's important to just to just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1040.9s	1040.9	 you know, pinpoint this like, forcing teachers to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1043.9s	1043.9	 vaccinated in order to, you know, work at the school. I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1048.5s	1048.5	 want to highlight the precedent it sets, right? Which is, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1052.1s	1052.1	 know, you just said, you don't want the government to tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1054.0s	1054.0	 people that they have to go get a shot in their arm, if someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1056.5s	1056.5	 has a personal choice, that they don't want to get that shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1060.8s	1060.8	 Does that mean then that they, you know, should lose their job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1064.8s	1064.8	 as a public servant?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1065.9s	1065.9	 Well, no, I mean, no, I'm saying that, look, I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1070.4s	1070.4	 deal. But like, if there's one or two teachers that say, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1072.7s	1072.7	 know what, it is a big deal to me, I have a different, I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 a set of reasons why I don't want to get shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1076.1s	1076.1	 I think those teachers, that's an assumption of risk. I mean, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1079.4s	1079.4	 they've decided they're going to assume the risk, then, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1082.5s	1082.5	 don't come crying to us when they get sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1085.8s	1085.8	 Well, the argument is that they're going to be the vector of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1088.3s	1088.3	 exposure, right? That they could potentially-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1090.1s	1090.1	 Yeah, and what if they're the petri dishes, as we talked about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1091.7s	1091.7	 They could be the vector that gets kids sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1093.8s	1093.8	 In all of these situations, there's an always a very obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1098.7s	1098.7	 and justifiable exemption for religious and medical reasons to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1103.4s	1103.4	 not be vaccinated, not just for this, but for anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1107.0s	1107.0	 So I struggle to understand why all of a sudden people who don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1111.6s	1111.6	 have a fucking clue about science are all of a sudden, these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1115.3s	1115.3	 armchair scientists who can judge whether or not a vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1119.9s	1119.9	 is appropriate for them, where they probably already gave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1123.6s	1123.6	 vaccines of all other kinds to their kids and themselves. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1127.2s	1127.2	 probably take all other kinds of advice from doctors, but on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1129.9s	1129.9	 this one specific issue, they narrowly say, you know what, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1133.3s	1133.3	 an expert enough because I'm watching this television show,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1135.4s	1135.4	 I've made a decision. That to me makes no sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1137.9s	1137.9	 Yeah, look, I actually agree with you. I'm in the camp of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1142.0s	1142.0	 everybody barring some, you know, highly specific medical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1146.3s	1146.3	 condition that renders you ineligible should be getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1149.3s	1149.3	 vaccinated. So I agree with you about what the right answer is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1152.9s	1152.9	 But I do think that when it comes to government, it's a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1156.8s	1156.8	 complicated question about how much power you give to government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1159.8s	1159.8	 to force people to engage in, you know, behavior they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1163.8s	1163.8	 want to engage in. Can you question private organizations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1167.8s	1167.8	 are different, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1168.5s	1168.5	 We all agree on private organizations, but we do have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1170.6s	1170.6	 make some decisions on public transportation. And we do have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1173.4s	1173.4	 to make decisions about teachers, and we're going to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1179.5s	1179.5	 teachers who are otherwise penalize them who are not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1185.0s	1185.0	 vaccinated, you know, there are sometimes where you know, a cop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1188.3s	1188.3	 or a teacher is put in a, you know, not in the classroom, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1192.7s	1192.7	 on the beat for whatever reasons, sometimes disciplinary,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1196.2s	1196.2	 but for other reasons, could you just say, Listen, if you're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1198.5s	1198.5	 going to get vaccinated, you're going to not be in the classroom,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1202.8s	1202.8	 you're not going to you'll be a remote teacher, and we're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1204.8s	1204.8	 going to create two classes here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1207.3s	1207.3	 I don't think I don't think there are many teachers who don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1210.3s	1210.3	 get vaccinated, but but I look, I think the virus is everywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1215.7s	1215.7	 now. It's just endemic. And so to single out like one particular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1219.1s	1219.1	 group and say you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1219.9s	1219.9	 trying to pin you down on your opinion. So you're saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1221.9s	1221.9	 teachers should not be forced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1224.3s	1224.3	 I'm saying that I mean, if they work in a private school, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1227.8s	1227.8	 private school could definitely require it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1229.7s	1229.7	 Public only now we all look on private.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1231.8s	1231.8	 Look, I think it's a really pin you down on it. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1234.4s	1234.4	 I think it's a really complicated question, because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1236.5s	1236.5	 think there are clear public health benefits to everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1239.1s	1239.1	 getting vaccinated by also don't really like empowering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1242.6s	1242.6	 government to force you because look, it's like everything else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1246.4s	1246.4	 the government may be right in this particular case, but what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1248.9s	1248.9	 else is it going to do with that power? And you know, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1252.3s	1252.3	 like giving government that power. So look, it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1254.6s	1254.6	 complicated question. I don't you know, it's not I would I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1258.5s	1258.5	 probably err on the side of not letting government force people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1261.9s	1261.9	 to do it. But but but look, I think it's a close call. I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1264.6s	1264.6	 think it's a close call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1266.0s	1266.0	 Jamoth, forced the teachers to get vaccinated or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1269.7s	1269.7	 Yes. And the reason is because these kids are already being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1275.9s	1275.9	 left behind, even when school is functioning normally. And you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1280.6s	1280.6	 can see it in the test scores, you can see it in our readiness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1283.5s	1283.5	 you can see it in our ability to actually do the jobs that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1287.1s	1287.1	 required. We are not doing what we need to do as it is in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1292.8s	1292.8	 absence of a pandemic. And now you introduce a reason for folks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1297.0s	1297.0	 to basically check out and not appear. What do you guys guess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1301.4s	1301.4	 how how many years were lost in these 15 months when kids were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1306.5s	1306.5	 at home? I would say not 15 months. No, it's more two years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1311.7s	1311.7	 two and a half years three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1314.6s	1314.6	 scarring depending on what grade they are. What did the did your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1317.0s	1317.0	 kids miss graduation? Did they miss senior prom? Did they miss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1320.5s	1320.5	 their SATs? I mean, what did they miss in terms of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1323.3s	1323.3	 Yeah, I mean, Jamoth is a good point, which is that if that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1327.6s	1327.6	 when government is the employer, requiring it on their employees,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1332.3s	1332.3	 because it leads to better outcomes for that institution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1337.7s	1337.7	 that is a little different than government just mandating that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1341.2s	1341.2	 you Jason Calcanis, private citizen have to go get a shot in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1344.6s	1344.6	 your arm, right? I mean, so there is a slight difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1347.4s	1347.4	 there, like military, for instance, right? The military
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 probably wants to vaccinate everybody. So that if they need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1353.8s	1353.8	 to be ready for a combat situation, they're not like, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1357.6s	1357.6	 know, incapacitated by an outbreak of COVID, right? So I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1362.0s	1362.0	 can, I think there, you know, we're getting into shades of gray
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1365.1s	1365.1	 here from a policy policy perspective. You know, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1368.9s	1368.9	 want teachers missing school because, you know, for weeks at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1372.3s	1372.3	 time, because they didn't do the obvious thing getting the COVID
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1375.3s	1375.3	 vaccine. So look, I think there are some really good policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1378.8s	1378.8	 arguments there. But I think, again, the, the one place where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1382.8s	1382.8	 I'd say government is clearly overstepping is if they just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1385.2s	1385.2	 said, listen, you private citizen, not an employee of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1388.9s	1388.9	 government has to go get vaccinated. As much as I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1393.0s	1393.0	 like everyone to get vaccinated, I don't want to give government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1396.3s	1396.3	 that kind of power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1397.0s	1397.0	 President Biden could legally require military members to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1400.3s	1400.3	 vaccinated, but so far he has declined to do so July 9, New
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1404.3s	1404.3	 York Times. Friedberg, where do you stand on this? Chamath says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1410.1s	1410.1	 he's all in your teacher, you get vaccinated at the end. Sax is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1414.0s	1414.0	 kind of close, but is a little concerned. What do you say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1416.9s	1416.9	 Friedberg?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1417.3s	1417.3	 I mean, another way to frame it is that there's a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1420.5s	1420.5	 qualification for a job. Like, you know, there's qualification
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1423.7s	1423.7	 to be in the military, you have to have certain physical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1426.6s	1426.6	 capabilities. Jason, I don't know if you would qualify. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1430.9s	1430.9	 don't think I would. I don't think I can do like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1433.0s	1433.0	 for totally different reasons. Your inability to fight or throw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1436.5s	1436.5	 a punch would be...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1438.3s	1438.3	 No, maybe J. Cal could eat the enemy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1443.6s	1443.6	 I would be great in the military.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1445.4s	1445.4	 He'd be like, Clemenza, he'd be cooking the meatballs or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1447.7s	1447.7	 something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1450.3s	1450.3	 Private Joker, private pile of doughnut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1454.8s	1454.8	 There's the, I think the reason there's sensitivity to it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1457.6s	1457.6	 because there are existing teachers in jobs. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1460.8s	1460.8	 you're telling them that in order to keep your job, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1462.8s	1462.8	 have to go get a vaccine. Now, if we were to have zero
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1466.1s	1466.1	 teachers today, and we were starting a public school system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1469.1s	1469.1	 from scratch, and you said, here's one of the qualifying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1471.9s	1471.9	 criteria to be a school teacher, you have to have an education
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1474.7s	1474.7	 degree, you have to have maybe a master's degree in education,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1477.7s	1477.7	 you have to have appropriate qualifications and training and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1480.1s	1480.1	 certification. Oh, and by the way, you also have to have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1482.5s	1482.5	 vaccine. If that becomes a criteria, I think people find it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1486.3s	1486.3	 less offensive. It's the fact that we are now saying that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1489.7s	1489.7	 there are people that are being told that you have to go get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1493.1s	1493.1	 shot in order to keep your job. And that's the complicating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1496.9s	1496.9	 thing that I think people are trying to wade through. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1499.3s	1499.3	 have I don't think that if you were to say like, look, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1501.6s	1501.6	 obvious that the qualifying criteria to be in the military
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1503.7s	1503.7	 is you have to be able to run and do push ups or whatever the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1506.2s	1506.2	 criteria might be. But if you impose that on people that were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1509.4s	1509.4	 already in the military, and then you're going to kick a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1511.0s	1511.0	 bunch of them out, people would be up in arms about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1514.1s	1514.1	 If you had a BMI requirement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1516.0s	1516.0	 Yeah, and that's the concern I think that arises with, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1519.5s	1519.5	 know, imposing these kind of, you know, personal body criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1525.6s	1525.6	 upon, you know, specific jobs when people are already employed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1528.5s	1528.5	 in that job. And it's there's there's absolutely no answer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1532.3s	1532.3	 right? Like, if you're going to do it, you're going to have

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1538.6s	1538.6	 and we're not in a circumstance where we can build these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1540.8s	1540.8	 organizations and these institutions from scratch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1542.9s	1542.9	 Look, there's a lot of social issues where you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1546.6s	1546.6	 particularly on the liberal side, people do not want the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1550.2s	1550.2	 government prohibiting them from getting certain medical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1554.3s	1554.3	 procedures, right? Well, you know, I'd say it's even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1558.1s	1558.1	 invasive talking about people transitioning, or, you know, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1561.9s	1561.9	 the issue of abortion, you know, very hot button social issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1564.6s	1564.6	 where people are saying, the government should not have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1567.2s	1567.2	 right to legislate. What happens with what happens with what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1571.3s	1571.3	 happens with my body, right? Well, force it, you know, giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1575.0s	1575.0	 government the power to forcibly inject you with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1578.4s	1578.4	 something is, you know, that is that is invasive. And so I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1583.5s	1583.5	 think there are like rights implications to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1586.1s	1586.1	 But I want to be very clear. If you want the services that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1591.4s	1591.4	 offered to you by the collective whole, if you want to consume and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1597.1s	1597.1	 be a net drag on the resources that we share, then you need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1604.0s	1604.0	 sign up for the compact that we all sign up for. That's, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1607.3s	1607.3	 my overarching argument. The thing with abortion, where I'm on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1611.7s	1611.7	 the other side of the issue, just to be very clear is like, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1615.9s	1615.9	 is a woman's body. I don't think I have any right to dictate what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1620.5s	1620.5	 she does. I don't understand what she goes through. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1624.5s	1624.5	 understand what situation she's in. I don't think I have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1627.6s	1627.6	 judgment to do that. It doesn't have an impact on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1630.7s	1630.7	 collective and her decision to carry or not carry a baby
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1635.1s	1635.1	 doesn't theoretically come with a probabilistic chance that I may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1639.2s	1639.2	 die. It does not. Right. But when you choose to not get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1643.9s	1643.9	 vaccinated to a highly transmissible respiratory disease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1647.1s	1647.1	 that could kill me or mutate, yeah, I'm not saying that I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1650.7s	1650.7	 a say, but I do think I should have a say if you're then all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1653.6s	1653.6	 a sudden going to consume the same resources that I consume,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1656.4s	1656.4	 where I've signed up to that compact for public health based
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1659.3s	1659.3	 on all this, here's where I come to what if we gave teachers an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1662.8s	1662.8	 off ramp, listen, if you, you need to be vaccinated to be in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1666.9s	1666.9	 the classroom, if not, you're going to get a one year buyout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1669.6s	1669.6	 or whatever one month or two months for every year of service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1672.7s	1672.7	 Have you been with us for 20 years, you can get 20 months of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1675.2s	1675.2	 pay. And or you could say if the virus is spreading at under this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1680.8s	1680.8	 rate, in other words, you know, we've got under 1% of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1684.7s	1684.7	 population infected or whatever the criteria is, then you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1687.9s	1687.9	 come to work in the classroom. But if this thing is spreading,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1691.0s	1691.0	 you're out. And that's it. And there's an offer amp here, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1694.6s	1694.6	 David's point, unless there's an arrow, like, look, I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1697.6s	1697.6	 you can be a conscientious objector for legitimate reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1700.3s	1700.3	 Again, like we have these very specific definitions for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1703.9s	1703.9	 religious, or for health specific reasons that you do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1707.3s	1707.3	 you don't get vaccinated, I think those should be respected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1710.3s	1710.3	 It's not that cohort of people we're talking about, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1712.8s	1712.8	 everybody else that right now wants to not think for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1716.8s	1716.8	 themselves. And as a result, put everybody else and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1720.3s	1720.3	 themselves in danger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1722.7s	1722.7	 Yeah, I think the most compelling part of your argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1725.3s	1725.3	 schmoth is that we're is the health externality, right, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1729.7s	1729.7	 that that each person's decision does have an impact on whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1734.9s	1734.9	 they could be transmitting, you know, multiplicative, contagious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1739.5s	1739.5	 particles. And this is why I was in favor of a mass mandate at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1742.5s	1742.5	 the beginning of the pandemic is, it's not just an individual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1745.4s	1745.4	 decision, your your choice actually does affect whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1749.3s	1749.3	 other people get sick. So, you know, this is why I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1753.9s	1753.9	 it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1754.0s	1754.0	 also wasn't very invasive, correct, Zach, I mean, was your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1756.3s	1756.3	 other point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1756.9s	1756.9	 Yes, exactly. The potentially high benefit for very low cost. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1761.9s	1761.9	 think we're but but but the thing that maybe I didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1765.3s	1765.3	 necessarily take into consideration is, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1767.8s	1767.8	 people complied in such a half hearted way. I mean, I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1771.1s	1771.1	 the mass makes a difference. If it's an N95 quality mask that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1775.2s	1775.2	 you put on correctly, right? But when people just strap a sock to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1778.5s	1778.5	 their face is loosely fitting, and they don't give a shit. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1781.7s	1781.7	 mean, does that really make a difference? I mean, I'm very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1783.7s	1783.7	 skeptical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1784.1s	1784.1	 Let me ask you a question, sacks, and then we'll go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1786.6s	1786.6	 freeburg. And then we'll flip to the next topic. If we were on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1789.8s	1789.8	 our third pandemic, or let's God forbid, a second pandemic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1793.3s	1793.3	 starts a totally different one, you know, Ebola type or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1796.5s	1796.5	 something, and we're on the fifth variant, and people are dying at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1800.1s	1800.1	 a higher rate. Does your calculus change sacks? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1804.1s	1804.1	 because the the downsides that the costs of, you know, not not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1810.6s	1810.6	 imposing those more restrictive regulations goes up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1813.9s	1813.9	 considerably. I mean, definitely my thinking today is highly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1817.3s	1817.3	 influenced by the fact that that if you're vaccinated, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1822.3s	1822.3	 call it 95% likely to be taking the most deadly or serious risks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1827.8s	1827.8	 off the table. And so the people who are choosing not to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1831.3s	1831.3	 vaccinated, are essentially assuming the risk, you know, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1834.6s	1834.6	 like, it's like smoking in a way where, when I made the movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1837.6s	1837.6	 thing for smoking, Christopher Buckley told me, you know, he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1839.9s	1839.9	 the author of the book. And he said, Look, there's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1842.5s	1842.5	 uniquely American about defending people's right to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1845.9s	1845.9	 something that's manifestly harmful, right? You're the main
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1849.2s	1849.2	 character. And thank you for smoking is a spokesman for Big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1851.9s	1851.9	 Tobacco. And he's engaging in political spin. But his argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1855.3s	1855.3	 is, look, people have the right to engage in this behavior, even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1858.3s	1858.3	 if it is known to be harmful to them. Maybe America is the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1861.9s	1861.9	 place in the world where people buy into arguments like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1864.7s	1864.7	 But I do. I you know, look, that is that is, that's freedom is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1869.7s	1869.7	 letting people do stupid things, you know, and, and so we have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1873.5s	1873.5	 weigh the benefits of freedom against the against the costs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1878.6s	1878.6	 And by the way, sorry, can I just say something? Smoking is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1883.1s	1883.1	 perfect example, because as you know, there is now a non trivial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1888.9s	1888.9	 amount of law around the liability related to individuals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1893.1s	1893.1	 that enabled secondhand smoke, both the smoker, but also other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1897.9s	1897.9	 things, condo boards, other places where all of a sudden, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1901.3s	1901.3	 didn't choose to fucking have, you know, tar and nicotine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1904.8s	1904.8	 right bar tenders, my dad worked in bars where people it was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1908.1s	1908.1	 cloud of smoke for 30 years, 30 years, right, they told him he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1912.5s	1912.5	 was essentially a smoker. It's not it's not just the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1914.5s	1914.5	 detrimental activity at the time. Remember, we've socialized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1918.2s	1918.2	 the cost of treatment for people through public health systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1923.1s	1923.1	 And because of that, it's not just an individual's choice, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1926.8s	1926.8	 there is a socialized cost for everyone that's now got to pay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1930.0s	1930.0	 the price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1930.7s	1930.7	 But the government is so omnipresent, all of our lives,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1933.7s	1933.7	 there's always going to be a social cost to any bad choice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1936.5s	1936.5	 people make. And to Tomas point, I mean, everybody uses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1939.7s	1939.7	 government services to some degree. So that alone can't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1942.6s	1942.6	 the reason I do agree that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1945.7s	1945.7	 behavior David, what about people speeding on highways at 125
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1948.9s	1948.9	 miles an hour? Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1949.8s	1949.8	 that's illegal. That's illegal. But but I think I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1952.6s	1952.6	 Tramatha is right that the smoking example is a good one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1954.7s	1954.7	 because we do regulate secondhand smoke, because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1957.9s	1957.9	 an externality, there's a health externality to everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1961.4s	1961.4	 If you smoke in a public place, and so we restrict that, but we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1964.8s	1964.8	 don't make smoking illegal, we don't stop you from doing it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1967.5s	1967.5	 your own homes, or in private places. And the argument is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1970.7s	1970.7	 listen, if you want to do something that's harmful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1973.5s	1973.5	 primarily to you, that's your choice as an American. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1977.8s	1977.8	 and I know people, a lot of people don't like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1979.5s	1979.5	 Actually, this is the this I posted a tweet that I got just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1983.5s	1983.5	 because an opinion is wrong doesn't mean it should be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1986.6s	1986.6	 censored. Just because the behavior is harmful doesn't mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1990.4s	1990.4	 it should be prohibited just because something is beneficial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1993.5s	1993.5	 doesn't mean it should be required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1996.6s	1996.6	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1997.7s	1997.7	 It's a completely reasonable tweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=1999.9s	1999.9	 Yeah, I thought it was a pretty inoffensive anodyne tweet, just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2003.7s	2003.7	 reminding people that just because, again, something is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2007.1s	2007.1	 is positive doesn't mean you force people to do it. And just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2009.8s	2009.8	 because some behavior is harmful, you don't you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2013.2s	2013.2	 ban it. I think smoking is a great example of that, right? We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2016.3s	2016.3	 let people engage in behavior that's harmful to them, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2019.7s	2019.7	 freedom is a value in and of itself. For this, I was attacked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2024.2s	2024.2	 as a selfish asshole by by this other pod. And I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2029.5s	2029.5	 care swisher and cold takes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2033.1s	2033.1	 Professor what cold takes that literally made an index of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2038.3s	2038.3	 of Professor G's, you know, takes that Macy's would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2041.7s	2041.7	 incredible and Amazon will lose its money and yada yada. He's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2045.1s	2045.1	 kind of obsessed with YouTube, Chamath Prof G. Yeah, who just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2048.7s	2048.7	 got his show canceled on Bloomberg, but they were a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2050.4s	2050.4	 little carousel swisher was called sacks and asshole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2053.9s	2053.9	 Well triggered, it was bizarre that they would get so triggered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2056.9s	2056.9	 by this inoffensive tweet. But I think what you see here is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2059.7s	2059.7	 example of the way that the woke mind thinks which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2064.1s	2064.1	 well, hold on, I don't think Kara's woke. Are you kidding me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2067.7s	2067.7	 She's like, she's like the Madame do farger the woke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2070.6s	2070.6	 revolution. She's getting far. Madame Madame do farge was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2075.6s	2075.6	 character in the French Revolution who had knit the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2077.6s	2077.6	 names of the next person to be guillotined. And she was, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2082.5s	2082.5	 know, one of the the leaders of the sans q loss. No, look, Kara
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2085.7s	2085.7	 is constantly ginning up the mob to try and you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2088.2s	2088.2	 guillotine. So she's known non woke person. I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2091.5s	2091.5	 that that's true. That's true. I think she's kind of moderate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2093.9s	2093.9	 You're trying to you're trying to curry favor with her. So you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2096.1s	2096.1	 don't know. No, no, no, no, no. She I mean, she did get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2098.7s	2098.7	 right. You are an asshole. I mean, you are an asshole. She
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2101.0s	2101.0	 got that. But you're not old and failing. Well, you are kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2103.9s	2103.9	 old. You looked old. You look old. She's effectively saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2107.3s	2107.3	 we're all assholes because I think all of us have talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2110.4s	2110.4	 assholes. I'm an asshole. Own it. What? What's your other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2116.7s	2116.7	 choice? Being a whiner on the sidelines?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2119.8s	2119.8	 What we've said on the show is that we have a moral imperative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2122.5s	2122.5	 to get to get back to normal. Do we not? That is what we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2125.7s	2125.7	 said. And for that you've basically saying that that is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2129.7s	2129.7	 let them eat COVID position, right that we are basically we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2133.5s	2133.5	 don't care if people get sick and die because of COVID. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2136.0s	2136.0	 not true. You know, we just have about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2138.6s	2138.6	 here, I think we should make people get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2143.4s	2143.4	 Yeah, you're pretty close to getting people vaccinated. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2145.9s	2145.9	 asked you, Sachs, if there were three more variants, and this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2149.3s	2149.3	 was an acute situation you said you would force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2151.3s	2151.3	 Oh, look, if we had if we had a variant of COVID that was as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2155.3s	2155.3	 deadly as Ebola and as transmissible as Delta variant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2159.5s	2159.5	 it 100% changes the game. There's no question about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2162.7s	2162.7	 willing to change the government's ability to put a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2165.9s	2165.9	 based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2166.8s	2166.8	 it's a benefit. Yes, it's a benefit cost analysis and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2170.7s	2170.7	 reasonable. But look, I give freedom, a lot of weight and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2174.5s	2174.5	 part of my calculation is the fact that I can get vaccinated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2178.9s	2178.9	 to take to most likely take the most serious risks off the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2182.3s	2182.3	 table. So while I am impacted to some degree by other people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2187.1s	2187.1	 choices, I'm much less impacted now that we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2190.1s	2190.1	 but you're thinking about this, you're still have a problem with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2193.2s	2193.2	 the way you're thinking about this because you're using your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2195.3s	2195.3	 reviewing this as a linear problem. This thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2198.3s	2198.3	 transmutating. And so I know, but there are still billions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2202.0s	2202.0	 people all over the world who are unvaccinated and we'd be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2204.4s	2204.4	 better off focusing on getting them a Marshall Plan for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2208.7s	2208.7	 vaccines, all these unused doses, we're wasting our breath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2211.8s	2211.8	 in the United States trying to get these vaccine hesitant or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2215.1s	2215.1	 anti vax people to get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2216.7s	2216.7	 Did you guys see that Emmanuel Macron of France, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2222.9s	2222.9	 basically tightened all these restrictions around access to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2225.9s	2225.9	 public places, going into bars and cafes, they basically put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2229.3s	2229.3	 all these rules in place that you have to be vaccinated and he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2231.5s	2231.5	 did it in a public address on TV 22 million people watched it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2234.7s	2234.7	 Yeah. And then after he did this, suddenly the vaccination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2238.1s	2238.1	 signups went up to like 20,000 a minute, they got 4 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2241.4s	2241.4	 people sign up to get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2245.1s	2245.1	 I mean, in France, what's the point of being alive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2248.0s	2248.0	 And then let me throw a wet blanket on the framing of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2251.5s	2251.5	 on whether all of this talk about forcing vaccinations even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2254.7s	2254.7	 make sense or is possible. I have been to like three events
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2259.0s	2259.0	 over the last month or two, where I was required to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2261.9s	2261.9	 vaccinated. And I literally just took a photo of this index card
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2266.1s	2266.1	 that I got from this person and sent it to them, which I could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2269.3s	2269.3	 go make a Kinkos or I could print at home. So like, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2273.8s	2273.8	 my point is, I don't think that there's not a great digital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2276.6s	2276.6	 system today to enable the level of restriction that we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2280.5s	2280.5	 actually talking about. How are you actually going to know that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2283.3s	2283.3	 people go to the Warriors game are actually vaccinated? How are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2285.7s	2285.7	 you actually going to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2286.7s	2286.7	 they did it at Madison Square Garden, they literally had you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2289.0s	2289.0	 pull out your ID and they match your name to your vax card. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2292.3s	2292.3	 I think printing out a vax card and faking it could be a fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2296.4s	2296.4	 could be a $10,000 fine. And so you would do it like anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2299.4s	2299.4	 else. If you could you could make a bogus driver's license.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2302.9s	2302.9	 It's not digital, right? There's no there's no kind of centralized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2305.5s	2305.5	 system where we know who's actually been vaccinated, who's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2308.1s	2308.1	 not. So so much of this is just this like analog paper trail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2311.1s	2311.1	 thing of like, here's this piece of paper that says I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2313.0s	2313.0	 vaccinated. I think that you're never going to really close the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2316.1s	2316.1	 hole on this thing. Now you certainly will see the sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2318.3s	2318.3	 psychological behavior that they saw in France, which is you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2321.7s	2321.7	 announced the restrictions, you announced these rules, everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2324.1s	2324.1	 signs up or some number of people will sign up. But you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2327.2s	2327.2	 know, I'm not sure this actually ends up becoming this truly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2329.7s	2329.7	 enforceable mechanism of behavior in society over the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2333.4s	2333.4	 next, you know, short while maybe over time, we digitize all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2336.8s	2336.8	 this stuff, but we'll see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2337.9s	2337.9	 Yeah, the best the best the best case scenario is that because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2341.3s	2341.3	 delta is so transmissible, we get to herd immunity because all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2344.0s	2344.0	 the people who didn't get vaccinated, just get it and get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2346.5s	2346.5	 the natural antibodies and hopefully this thing turns out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2348.7s	2348.7	 we to that because we have 60% of adults in the United States
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2352.9s	2352.9	 have had one shot or more, which is why deaths probably aren't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2356.2s	2356.2	 going up because that's like 75% in people over 60. I think so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2360.1s	2360.1	 freeburg in your estimation as our science guy with what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2364.6s	2364.6	 have like 30 million people who've been infected that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2367.5s	2367.5	 know of you got to triple that number, right? Because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2369.7s	2369.7	 people who we don't know and then you have 65 you have 60% so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2373.9s	2373.9	 we got to be in the range of 70% have been exposed or been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2376.9s	2376.9	 vaccinated. So when does it kick in? Or are we experiencing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2381.1s	2381.1	 you know, herd immunity right now with these low deaths?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2384.6s	2384.6	 We talked about this before, but there are you know, there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2389.1s	2389.1	 spectrum of infection, right? You're you're you're you can have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2393.9s	2393.9	 viral replication happening in your body and then your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2396.5s	2396.5	 clears out the virus before you even know because you've got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2399.1s	2399.1	 enough antibodies to that particular strain of a variant of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2402.0s	2402.0	 a virus before your body even you know, you start to feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2405.5s	2405.5	 symptoms. And there are cases where the virus kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2409.1s	2409.1	 replicates in an uncontrolled way for a period of time and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2411.7s	2411.7	 have incredibly bad symptoms and you have inflammation and all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2413.9s	2413.9	 the stuff that follows. And so you know, in terms of how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2418.3s	2418.3	 measure this stuff, it's really difficult to say that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2422.8s	2422.8	 going to stop all viral replication by getting a certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2426.1s	2426.1	 number of people to be to have been exposed as we've seen, even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2430.1s	2430.1	 when you have a broad and diverse antibody pool in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2434.1s	2434.1	 body because you've been exposed to a vaccine, we are still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2437.5s	2437.5	 seeing that some of these variants can break through for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2439.9s	2439.9	 some period of time because there's not enough of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2441.8s	2441.8	 antibodies that can actually bind to that specific variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2445.0s	2445.0	 And so the rate of transmission slows, the rate of severe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2449.2s	2449.2	 infection goes way down, and so on. So it's not as binary as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2453.1s	2453.1	 hey, we hit herd immunity, and now we're done, it seems this is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2456.3s	2456.3	 you know, as we talked about earlier, and as I think everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2458.9s	2458.9	 is coming to terms with, this is going to be an endemic virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2463.1s	2463.1	 And that means that it's going to be circulating in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2465.3s	2465.3	 population in a modest way causing sometimes severe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2468.1s	2468.1	 sometimes, you know, modest outbreaks for likely a very long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2471.9s	2471.9	 time, no matter how many people get it, no matter how many people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2474.3s	2474.3	 get vaccinated, because you have different levels, should we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2476.7s	2476.7	 ignore it? At what level should we just say, listen, that is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2480.1s	2480.1	 steady state? How many cases a day? How many deaths a day? Do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2483.1s	2483.1	 you think is the steady state that we should just say, we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2486.2s	2486.2	 go to work and ignore it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2487.5s	2487.5	 I am a brutal, cold hearted libertarian on this point. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2491.1s	2491.1	 I have been since we first talked about this last year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2493.9s	2493.9	 I've always been of the mind that we need to balance the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2498.1s	2498.1	 follow on life effect and from the economic fallout associated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2502.4s	2502.4	 with making certain behavioral changes and restrictions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2505.7s	2505.7	 relative to the actual loss of life, right? So you can never go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2509.1s	2509.1	 I really think this point about zeroism and this term about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2512.4s	2512.4	 zeroism is an important one. You can never get to zero cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2516.1s	2516.1	 what is the acceptable number of cases? And what is the cost to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2519.0s	2519.0	 keep that caseload down? The balance of those two is a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2522.5s	2522.5	 difficult leadership decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2524.2s	2524.2	 Put a number on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2526.0s	2526.0	 But it's about saving lives, right? So like, there are a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2529.0s	2529.0	 certain number of people whose lives are going to be ruined, who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2531.3s	2531.3	 are some of them will commit suicide, some of them won't be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2533.4s	2533.4	 able to earn an income again, their businesses are going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2535.2s	2535.2	 shut down. What is the economic cost of that versus the economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2538.8s	2538.8	 cost of the loss of life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2540.1s	2540.1	 What I'm saying is what is the number we had an average of 250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2543.6s	2543.6	 deaths 250,000 case known cases a day at the peak, we had an a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2547.9s	2547.9	 peak deaths of 4100 a day, we are now at 200 people dying a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2553.3s	2553.3	 day. And you know, 30,000 cases, is there a number at which you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2557.4s	2557.4	 say, let's just focus on getting back to work? And is that number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2561.3s	2561.3	 where we are now? I'm trying to get in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2563.5s	2563.5	 Yeah, again, I wouldn't simplify it to those data points. What I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2566.3s	2566.3	 would do is, again, I would look at, you know, at what age are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2569.8s	2569.8	 people dying? How many life years are we losing? And how can we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2572.3s	2572.3	 address the acute populations that are at risk and the acute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2575.4s	2575.4	 populations that are that are potentially going to be exposed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2578.9s	2578.9	 manage those populations differently than you manage the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2581.4s	2581.4	 broader population that has a lower likelihood of risk of of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2584.3s	2584.3	 death and a lower likelihood of fatality. And the restrictions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2587.3s	2587.3	 that you then impose to, you know, start to manage the risk and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2591.0s	2591.0	 the exposure to different populations gets weighed against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2593.5s	2593.5	 the saving of life and the loss of life in both circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2596.3s	2596.3	 So it's not easy, right? It's, it's, and everyone wants to sum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2599.6s	2599.6	 this whole thing up to like, how many deaths a day is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2601.5s	2601.5	 appropriate? That's not the right answer, right? Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2604.1s	2604.1	 what you're saying, how many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2605.9s	2605.9	 that part of it is so obvious, right? That, and we should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2609.0s	2609.0	 known this last summer, the obvious part being that what you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2615.5s	2615.5	 population that's the most at risk. And what do we do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2618.3s	2618.3	 lockdowns? We literally locked down the entire population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2621.6s	2621.6	 every business, it was completely insane. We should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2624.9s	2624.9	 have focused it on protecting the most at risk populations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2628.7s	2628.7	 isolating the sick, or the people at greatest risk, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2632.2s	2632.2	 everybody was just insane. And I mean, I can't believe we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2636.0s	2636.0	 still having that conversation a year later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2638.6s	2638.6	 Can I before we move on to the next topic, can I can I read the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2641.9s	2641.9	 best? Can I read the best best comment from Saxe's tweet? So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2645.9s	2645.9	 Saxe's tweet, because an opinion is wrong doesn't mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2649.0s	2649.0	 it should be censored. Just because a behavior is harmful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2651.7s	2651.7	 doesn't mean it should be prohibited. And just because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2654.1s	2654.1	 something is beneficial doesn't mean it should be required. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2656.9s	2656.9	 best response goes to distantly social rumple, whose full name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2663.1s	2663.1	 is at Wendell shirk, who said, this message brought to you by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2668.4s	2668.4	 the generic self serving platitude alert network, to your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2673.6s	2673.6	 regularly scheduled episode of the bland soap opera with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2677.2s	2677.2	 pablum sisters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2678.7s	2678.7	 Well, yeah, I look, there's there's an element of truth to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2681.9s	2681.9	 that, which is I almost didn't tweet him, because I thought it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2684.6s	2684.6	 was too much of a platitude. But the fact that people on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2687.3s	2687.3	 other side got so triggered by it shows why it was actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2692.0s	2692.0	 useful to tweet it is they think that if you're calling for any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2697.4s	2697.4	 modicum of freedom or return to normalcy, you're basically a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2701.7s	2701.7	 selfish asshole. I mean, it's insane. I mean, they want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2705.1s	2705.1	 stay in this world of zero s COVID restrictions forever, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2709.2s	2709.2	 got to move on. We're 45 minutes into COVID. So we got to move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2711.9s	2711.9	 on. But I think if this is in the influenza, plus or minus 100%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2717.8s	2717.8	 zone, we got to pick a number where we decide we're moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2721.7s	2721.7	 forward as a society. And you know, local communities can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2724.7s	2724.7	 make decisions if they have outbreaks. But I kind of think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2727.2s	2727.2	 if this is within, you know, two acts of our yearly deaths from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2733.1s	2733.1	 you know, influenza and just the normal cold, I think we move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2736.0s	2736.0	 forward as best we can. Do we want to go to China, Cuba?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2739.8s	2739.8	 I think just real quick, before we move away from this, I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2742.4s	2742.4	 want to just highlight the deep mind announcement from this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2744.7s	2744.7	 morning, because I think it's actually quite relevant to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2747.4s	2747.4	 tracking of variance and what's been going on. Okay. So this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2751.2s	2751.2	 morning, you know, deep mind, which published alpha fold, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2754.5s	2754.5	 talked about this a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2756.3s	2756.3	 days ago. By Google, it's their AI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2758.3s	2758.3	 It's an AI arm owned by Google. And they basically took protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2762.1s	2762.1	 structure and tried to predict what a protein looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2765.9s	2765.9	 physically as a function of the DNA or RNA that codes the amino
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2771.1s	2771.1	 acids that make up the protein. And so again, like when you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2773.7s	2773.7	 a string of amino acids, they they combine and they fold into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2776.7s	2776.7	 a way that's really hard to predict. And that's the shape of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2779.0s	2779.0	 the molecule that we call the protein. And then it does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2781.2s	2781.2	 something in the body. And historically, we've had very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2784.2s	2784.2	 hard times understanding how genetic code translates into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2787.8s	2787.8	 physical structure of protein, which would allow us to predict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2790.4s	2790.4	 what that protein can then do in the body. So this morning, deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2794.2s	2794.2	 mind incredibly published a database with the predicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2798.8s	2798.8	 structure of every protein in the human body, and in 10 other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2802.4s	2802.4	 species using this this capability that they now have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2805.7s	2805.7	 What does it mean in English?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2807.1s	2807.1	 And so you know, what this means is we now have a physical model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2812.4s	2812.4	 of every protein that human DNA can make. And that model would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2817.2s	2817.2	 allow us to basically now predict what that protein does,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2820.8s	2820.8	 how it does it and how certain drugs can bind to those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2823.4s	2823.4	 proteins, and how certain drugs can affect those proteins and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2826.4s	2826.4	 how we can alter human health by making new molecules or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2831.3s	2831.3	 adjusting the genetic code to change the shape of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2834.1s	2834.1	 proteins in specific and targeted ways. So it's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2836.6s	2836.6	 incredible data set that was just published. It's almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2839.8s	2839.8	 like, you know, releasing the Rosetta Stone, in my opinion, in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2843.8s	2843.8	 terms of we now have this ability to translate human
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2846.2s	2846.2	 genetic code into the physical form of the molecules that run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2849.2s	2849.2	 our body and do things in our body. They did it for 10 other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2851.8s	2851.8	 species. And they said that they're going to publish this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2854.1s	2854.1	 proteome database and scale it for all other species of life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2857.2s	2857.2	 that we have the sort of data set around for which they expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2861.2s	2861.2	 we'll achieve over 100 million unique proteins in this database
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2864.7s	2864.7	 over the coming months freely available and searchable. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2867.2s	2867.2	 let me just explain and I know I'm on a monologue here. So I'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2869.6s	2869.6	 win the monologue stat. It's a good one. It's a good one. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2872.0s	2872.0	 let me just explain why this is relevant. The Delta variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2875.2s	2875.2	 What it is, is that you know, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2879.6s	2879.6	 about 30,000 base pairs long. 10% of those are about 3000 base
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2884.0s	2884.0	 pairs make up the spike protein, which is the protein at the tip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2886.8s	2886.8	 of the COVID virus that the coronavirus that gets into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2889.9s	2889.9	 cells. And, you know, for every 10 people that are infected with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2894.4s	2894.4	 coronavirus, there's about one nucleoside mutation, one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2898.3s	2898.3	 those base pairs changes and the virus evolves. And we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2902.2s	2902.2	 know how that change in that genetic code translates into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2906.8s	2906.8	 different structure of the protein. And so we suddenly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2909.9s	2909.9	 discover empirically and you know, by looking around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2912.7s	2912.7	 suddenly all these people are getting more infected than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2915.0s	2915.0	 we're getting infected before we look at the genetic code and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2917.3s	2917.3	 we're like, oh, here's the changes that happened. But we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2919.8s	2919.8	 could have with this capability from Alpha Fold predicted what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2923.7s	2923.7	 changes make the spike protein do a better job binding to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2928.0s	2928.0	 human ACE2 receptors on the cells and getting it to cells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2930.9s	2930.9	 And what other changes could be made in the whole genome of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2934.6s	2934.6	 SARS-CoV-2 virus that could cause this virus to be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2937.8s	2937.8	 transmissible, more deadly, all these sorts of factors because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2940.8s	2940.8	 we can now estimate the physical form of that protein by changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2945.5s	2945.5	 the base pair. And so this tool that was released today, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2948.6s	2948.6	 highlights that over the next decade, these sorts of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2951.3s	2951.3	 that are going on with viruses mutating and variants occurring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2955.0s	2955.0	 that are affecting our population can be better estimated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2958.2s	2958.2	 and tracked digitally. And it gives us the ability to start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2961.4s	2961.4	 prepare tools and defense mechanisms against them with new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2964.7s	2964.7	 drugs and new variant models and new vaccines well ahead of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2969.7s	2969.7	 oh my god, we just got hit with a nuclear bomb, let's clean up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2972.0s	2972.0	 the mess kind of in the future. So it's an exciting day and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2975.2s	2975.2	 exciting moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2976.0s	2976.0	 Would they have been released this, David, if it hadn't been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2981.0s	2981.0	 for COVID coming out? Do you think DeepMind just pivoted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2984.4s	2984.4	 their entire group? Because they have about 1000 people, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2986.8s	2986.8	 understand. And by the way, they pay something in the order of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2990.0s	2990.0	 six or 700,000 a year on average. And there's many people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2993.3s	2993.3	 there who are getting paid millions of dollars a year. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2995.8s	2995.8	 just think about the scale of what Google is spending on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=2998.6s	2998.6	 you guys know that I probably shifted a large number of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3002.3s	3002.3	 to work on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3003.1s	3003.1	 You guys know that I have long deep roots at Google. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3007.0s	3007.0	 will tell you that the value system of people there, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3010.7s	3010.7	 the press and the public will think what they want. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3013.7s	3013.7	 think that the value system of people there drove them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3016.8s	3016.8	 realize the importance of this work that they're doing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3019.5s	3019.5	 Alpha Fold. And it is important for humanity. And it's important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3022.2s	3022.2	 for the health broadly of people, they could have kept it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3024.1s	3024.1	 all inside and used it to build therapeutic drug companies and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3027.2s	3027.2	 make money from that. And I think the importance of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3029.7s	3029.7	 discovery and this capability was, was realized and is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3033.9s	3033.9	 published for that very reason. There's a lot of work that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3036.8s	3036.8	 DeepMind does to optimize ad targeting and ad spending and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3040.0s	3040.0	 all this stuff. And they make tens of billions of dollars of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3042.2s	3042.2	 incremental revenue for Google per year based on those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3044.6s	3044.6	 capabilities. And then there are these things that benefit all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3047.2s	3047.2	 of us. And by putting this out publicly, it's a great good for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3050.3s	3050.3	 humanity. And, you know, they're making it freely available and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3054.4s	3054.4	 searchable. And so I don't think that COVID kind of instigated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3058.2s	3058.2	 this because they've been working on this for a very long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3060.3s	3060.3	 time since before COVID. And this is a very hard biological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3063.6s	3063.6	 problem that is key to understanding biology and how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3066.2s	3066.2	 biology works that's been going on for decades. They've unlocked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3069.1s	3069.1	 it with software, and they're making it freely available. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3072.5s	3072.5	 you know, there will be hundreds of drug companies that will now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3074.7s	3074.7	 start because of what's in that database.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3077.6s	3077.6	 This is a mitzvah to society to humanity. Does it change the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3082.5s	3082.5	 fact that Google spending well over a billion dollars a year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3085.2s	3085.2	 in DeepMind and doing projects like this? Does this change any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3087.6s	3087.6	 you're thinking about breaking them up, Chamath or you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3091.3s	3091.3	 how we look at big tech?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3093.0s	3093.0	 That's a good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3093.8s	3093.8	 No. Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3095.7s	3095.7	 where would that fucking come from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3097.3s	3097.3	 Yeah, where does it where does this kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3098.9s	3098.9	 we learned something very disturbing about big tech this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3101.0s	3101.0	 week, actually. This is quite a bombshell that Jen Pesachy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3105.0s	3105.0	 dropped from the White House press briefing. We got to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3108.9s	3108.9	 about this. She just sort of casually mentioned that Oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3111.9s	3111.9	 yeah, by the way, the administration is flagging posts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3115.8s	3115.8	 for social media company for big tech companies to take down to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3119.0s	3119.0	 remove accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3120.7s	3120.7	 specific accounts and posts. Yeah. And she just kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3123.5s	3123.5	 meant just casually mentions Oh, yeah, the big tech companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3126.6s	3126.6	 are very, you know, eagerly cooperating with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3129.4s	3129.4	 administration to take down these counts, accounts. She even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3132.3s	3132.3	 said that when one of these companies takes down an account,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3137.3s	3137.3	 the rest should do it too. Implying that the White House is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3140.6s	3140.6	 providing the central coordinative role in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3143.5s	3143.5	 censorship global block list. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3147.9s	3147.9	 Let's let's take the most charitable view here. I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3150.1s	3150.1	 that it's very easy to make this a left versus right. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3153.0s	3153.0	 censoring yada yada Trump got banned. But if somebody was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3156.2s	3156.2	 saying this was microchip, this was an account that was claiming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3160.0s	3160.0	 that microchips were in the vaccine, would it not be how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3164.6s	3164.6	 would the and it was hitting scale? You know, what would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3169.4s	3169.4	 the way for the White House to inform social media that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3172.5s	3172.5	 was an account that was saying falsely that microchips were in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3176.8s	3176.8	 there and that that was trending.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3178.2s	3178.2	 The White House or its officials are free to put out their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3180.8s	3180.8	 statements and their position. But this is different. This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3183.7s	3183.7	 the White House coordinating behind the scenes with big tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3186.4s	3186.4	 companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3186.9s	3186.9	 with that behind the scenes are saying they're doing it right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3188.8s	3188.8	 here to everybody. Correct, correct. The behavior was behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3191.6s	3191.6	 the scenes, but to Pesaki just admitted it, which is why it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3194.2s	3194.2	 such a bombshell. Look, even the ACLU
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3196.6s	3196.6	 if you were president, and there was an account on Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3201.0s	3201.0	 YouTube, Twitter that was saying there was a microchip from Bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3203.6s	3203.6	 Gates, this is a this is a blatant violation of the people's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3207.2s	3207.2	 First Amendment rights, tell them how would you you are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3209.9s	3209.9	 allowed your the First Amendment gives you the right to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3212.9s	3212.9	 things that are untrue. It is not the business of government to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3216.8s	3216.8	 declare what is true and what is false. Okay, even even hold on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3221.0s	3221.0	 even the ACLU I'm not done. Even the ACLU came out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3224.5s	3224.5	 retirement, we hadn't we haven't heard from them for the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3227.0s	3227.0	 year. During any of the ACLU. We haven't heard from them during
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3231.0s	3231.0	 the past year. During all of this activity has been going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3233.8s	3233.8	 with accounts being blocked and ghosted. And they finally came
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3236.6s	3236.6	 out of retirement to say that that this is a dangerous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3241.2s	3241.2	 violation of people's First Amendment rights, you cannot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3244.4s	3244.4	 have the government saying what is true and what is false and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3247.6s	3247.6	 then denying people the right to express their opinions based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3252.1s	3252.1	 what the government thinks is the truth. And by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3254.8s	3254.8	 there's been a very subtle change here in the language that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3258.9s	3258.9	 being used. If you remember what the argument used to be that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3263.4s	3263.4	 have to stop disinformation does now it's shifted to have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3267.2s	3267.2	 stop misinformation. So those two things are very different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3270.2s	3270.2	 It's kind of like that. Well, it's kind of like the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3272.8s	3272.8	 in the term equality versus equity. They sound similar, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3276.0s	3276.0	 they actually mean very different things. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3277.9s	3277.9	 disinformation is actually a campaign of purposeful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3282.8s	3282.8	 purposeful campaign of propaganda and lies usually put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3286.4s	3286.4	 forward covertly. So it's the FSB, you're some intelligence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3290.2s	3290.2	 agency putting out whatever putting out disinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3293.4s	3293.4	 usually under false accounts. So in that case, we can say no, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3298.3s	3298.3	 can't do that because you can't engage in deception around who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3302.6s	3302.6	 you are, right. But misinformation is simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3306.0s	3306.0	 information that's being put out that frankly, you disagree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3308.6s	3308.6	 with. Okay. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3310.5s	3310.5	 or could be discernibly wrong. Wait, you're, you're kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3312.7s	3312.7	 framing that right. It could be you're putting out information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3315.6s	3315.6	 like there's a microchip in the vaccine that is explicitly known
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3318.7s	3318.7	 to be wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3319.4s	3319.4	 Look, the lab leak theory was considered misinformation by

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3324.1s	3324.1	 Okay, let's take the specific example of there's a microchip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3327.3s	3327.3	 If the if it was the case that they said there's a microchip in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3330.0s	3330.0	 the vaccine, would you be okay with the White House contacting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3332.7s	3332.7	 social media companies saying, hey, you got these accounts that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3334.8s	3334.8	 are saying there's a microchip, you might want to look into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3337.5s	3337.5	 They're not saying take it down. They're saying take a look into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3339.6s	3339.6	 it. That's not the White House's business. Do I believe in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3341.8s	3341.8	 microchip theory? No, of course not. It's absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3343.8s	3343.8	 ridiculous. But it is not the business of government to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3347.6s	3347.6	 telling social media who to ban and who to block list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3351.2s	3351.2	 I think they didn't tell him to ban it. I think they told him to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3353.3s	3353.3	 be aware of it. Go ahead, Chamath. I think you're framing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3356.0s	3356.0	 wrong sex. No, no. Tosaki said that when one site takes it down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3359.8s	3359.8	 they should all take it down. And then Biden on top of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3362.7s	3362.7	 comes out and pours kerosene on the fire by saying that social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3366.5s	3366.5	 media sites are literally killing people. Well, yeah, by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3370.1s	3370.1	 allowing by allowing this misinformation. So here we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3373.1s	3373.1	 seen now let's be honest. He's a president. This is the President
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3376.6s	3376.6	 of the United States using the bully pulpit to call social media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3380.9s	3380.9	 sites mass murderers by virtue of allowing people to have free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3384.5s	3384.5	 speech. Trump never used language that intemperate. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3387.0s	3387.0	 don't remember him ever calling God, American companies. Go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3390.3s	3390.3	 ahead, Chamath. Speak. Let's not speak. This is the exact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3393.5s	3393.5	 reason you you can't have a stranglehold on distribution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3398.7s	3398.7	 because it will get perverted. And then we either have people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3403.3s	3403.3	 we like or people we don't like in these positions of power, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3407.2s	3407.2	 people we like or people we don't like regulating and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3409.8s	3409.8	 constantly flipping. And we're all just doomed and bound to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3413.9s	3413.9	 fucked over. So back to the thing that Friedberg brought up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3418.0s	3418.0	 before I think Alpha Fold is incredible. I think Google has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3421.3s	3421.3	 been an incredible company. They make money hand over fist, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3425.6s	3425.6	 waste an enormous amount of money and all kinds of trash. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3429.1s	3429.1	 it's good that they were actually able to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3431.1s	3431.1	 useful here. I generally think that companies like Google and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3436.4s	3436.4	 Facebook and Amazon, unfortunately do not allow the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3446.5s	3446.5	 constructive form of capitalism that people want in today's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3449.5s	3449.5	 society. They're just too big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3450.9s	3450.9	 Chamath makes a great point, which is we've got these big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3452.9s	3452.9	 tech monopolies who've become gatekeepers over content, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3456.1s	3456.1	 And what the administration has done and their allies in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3459.2s	3459.2	 Congress is hang a sword of Damocles over the heads of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3462.8s	3462.8	 these big tech companies. They've appointed Lena Cahn to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3465.4s	3465.4	 be the enforcer at the FTC. They've got their six bills in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3468.5s	3468.5	 Congress right now. They've held congressional hearings around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3471.1s	3471.1	 taking away section 230 protection, which is very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3473.6s	3473.6	 economically advantageous for these big tech companies. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3476.7s	3476.7	 they position the sword perfectly over the heads of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3479.2s	3479.2	 these big tech companies, threatening to break them up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3481.8s	3481.8	 rein them in. And then Jen Psaki in the White House go to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3485.5s	3485.5	 and say, we want you to take down these accounts that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3488.7s	3488.7	 don't agree with. This is misinformation. Okay, that is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3492.6s	3492.6	 huge danger to free speech. It's basically like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3495.6s	3495.6	 administration saying to these big tech companies, nice little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3498.4s	3498.4	 social network you got there. It'd be a real shame if anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3501.1s	3501.1	 happened to it. Look at what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3503.1s	3503.1	 Don't you want them broken up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3505.4s	3505.4	 I do want them broken up. But what I don't know which is it, do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3507.8s	3507.8	 you want them to hold the sword? Or do you not want them to hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3510.0s	3510.0	 the sword?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3510.4s	3510.4	 I actually want the sword to come crashing. I actually want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3512.7s	3512.7	 the sword to come down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3513.8s	3513.8	 Swing the sword, not hold it over and then use it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3516.3s	3516.3	 extortion. Yes, that's actually a great explanation. Then free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3519.2s	3519.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3520.6s	3520.6	 I'm trying to moderate your free bird. I do give a shit. We
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3523.9s	3523.9	 talked about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3524.5s	3524.5	 Freeberg spent all day on his phone. He is not dialed into

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3530.0s	3530.0	 I thought we just went over the Alpha Fold stuff way too fast. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3533.6s	3533.6	 mean, the arguing over freedom of speech is happening and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3539.4s	3539.4	 this debate, Friedberg at the same time that we are making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3543.0s	3543.0	 incredible life changing moments for humanity. Two different

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3552.8s	3552.8	 are basically defining the blueprint for the human and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3573.8s	3573.8	 saw this Friedberg, but how do you think about the space race
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3578.4s	3578.4	 in relation to reading the room, etc.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3587.2s	3587.2	 can assume that that progress you know, it's not like someone

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3596.0s	3596.0	 years of toiling and labs like Edison did making the light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3599.3s	3599.3	 bulb. Edison had to raise a ton of money to get that light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3603.8s	3603.8	 bulb project off the ground. If you guys haven't read, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3607.1s	3607.1	 trying to remember the biography there's a Wizards of something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3611.9s	3611.9	 was it's got Wizards in the title. It's a good biography of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3613.8s	3613.8	 Edison. And you know, and I feel like we're at this moment where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3619.9s	3619.9	 the Wizard of Menlo Park. Yeah, I think that's the Wizard of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3623.0s	3623.0	 Menlo Park. That's right. And the amount of capital that it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3626.8s	3626.8	 takes to make these breakthroughs at Alpha Fold or at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3629.8s	3629.8	 Waymo or what Bezos and Elon are doing is so extraordinary that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3636.8s	3636.8	 you have to be in a position where you can fund this work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3639.8s	3639.8	 you're not going to get a bunch of kickstarters to fund a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3642.9s	3642.9	 SpaceX like project or a you know, Blue Origin like project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3647.1s	3647.1	 And so I think that the benefit of scale that comes out of some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3651.9s	3651.9	 of these businesses is that we can do research and development
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3656.1s	3656.1	 and we can progress our capabilities as a species

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3663.1s	3663.1	 the capitalist system and the ability for these businesses to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3665.8s	3665.8	 accumulate a large enough pool of capital to take on multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3669.5s	3669.5	 billion dollar bets. And like Chamath said, waste a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3672.2s	3672.2	 money and lose on nine out of 10 of them. But if that $1 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3675.3s	3675.3	 bet works, it's worth $500 billion. And that money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3678.6s	3678.6	 continuously gets reinvested. And look at what Google did with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3681.7s	3681.7	 Waymo. They put over a billion dollars in that project before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3684.2s	3684.2	 everyone woke up and said, my God, self driving is real, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3686.6s	3686.6	 possible. And it kickstarted an industry. And I just feel like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3690.4s	3690.4	 the amount of money and not to mention the fact that like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3693.2s	3693.2	 these are free markets. So these businesses, Google, you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3696.6s	3696.6	 have to search on Google, you don't have to buy from Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3699.6s	3699.6	 but everyone benefits from searching on Google, everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3702.0s	3702.0	 benefits from buying on Amazon. And the capability of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3705.1s	3705.1	 businesses is rooted entirely on the fact that consumers are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3708.2s	3708.2	 choosing to use their products and their services, because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3711.2s	3711.2	 are so good. And so I don't feel like these guys are screwing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3715.5s	3715.5	 people over. You can consider the small business model as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3718.9s	3718.9	 being like, you know, hey, maybe we shouldn't have had small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3721.6s	3721.6	 business retailers for as long as we did, because at some point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3724.8s	3724.8	 distribution was going to be economically advantaged by being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3727.1s	3727.1	 centralized. And therefore, all consumers are going to benefit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3730.2s	3730.2	 by centralizing. Is there really a right to maintain local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3733.6s	3733.6	 distribution sites that we call small businesses that should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3736.2s	3736.2	 remain in business forever? Maybe there's a way to help them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3738.6s	3738.6	 transition into a new business model or a new market. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3741.0s	3741.0	 same with what happened with the taxi industry. Technology will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3743.9s	3743.9	 force these evolutions, the capital accumulates and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3746.4s	3746.4	 capital can be invested in things that we would have never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3748.3s	3748.3	 imagined on a smaller scale. But go ahead, show them up. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3752.1s	3752.1	 No, I do think sympathetic to what you were saying. I do think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3754.5s	3754.5	 that if you look at every platform innovation that's ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3756.9s	3756.9	 happened, so whether it's, you know, we go from no print to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3761.1s	3761.1	 print, you know, to newspapers to radio to television, you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3765.4s	3765.4	 always first started with a pendulum that was very much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3768.6s	3768.6	 firmly in the camp of centralized, monopolistic or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3774.2s	3774.2	 oligopolistic, kind of early outcomes. And either through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3779.6s	3779.6	 legislation or through innovation, then the pendulum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3782.3s	3782.3	 swings to decentralization. That's typically happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3785.2s	3785.2	 right? And you can look at all of these industries that's gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3787.4s	3787.4	 through that. So it stands to reason that technology will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3791.0s	3791.0	 not dissimilar to those things. And everybody says the argument
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3794.1s	3794.1	 is, well, no, because technology has these specific features of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3797.2s	3797.2	 network effects and lock in. But I think that betrays this idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3801.4s	3801.4	 that legislatively, you can come and just basically destroy the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3804.6s	3804.6	 China and the China shop and you have to just start all over. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3807.9s	3807.9	 it's likely that we're going to move to a place that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3809.9s	3809.9	 healthier outcome for everybody. And obviously, we want things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3813.2s	3813.2	 like Alpha Fold to exist. And we want things like Waymo to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3816.7s	3816.7	 exist. The question is, how should they exist? And if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3820.7s	3820.7	 come out of the goodwill of Google, it is just so easily as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3825.9s	3825.9	 likely that some other person, let's say it wasn't Sundar and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3830.3s	3830.3	 Ruth Peratt, but two other people who didn't like it, these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3833.6s	3833.6	 things could have been very different forms and shapes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3835.8s	3835.8	 not existed at all. And I think that's the arbitrary nature of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3838.9s	3838.9	 it, which is not necessarily free market capitalism that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3841.4s	3841.4	 doesn't benefit us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3842.5s	3842.5	 Should we Chamath be upset that Bezos is going to space and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3847.1s	3847.1	 spending 10s of billions of dollars that he made from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3849.8s	3849.8	 Amazon?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3850.8s	3850.8	 He had a bad press conference. Let's just be clear. At the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3854.3s	3854.3	 of the day, he has wanted to do this his entire life. He built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3858.0s	3858.0	 an incredible company, he was able to take a lot of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3861.4s	3861.4	 capital and invested in it. He's invested billions of dollars in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3865.9s	3865.9	 other things $10 billion in climate change. His ex wife has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3869.6s	3869.6	 invested, you know, $6 billion just last year alone and all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3873.0s	3873.0	 kinds of good works. So those two individuals, because of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3877.5s	3877.5	 their success, I think will generally do and have done the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3880.8s	3880.8	 right thing. Let's not get that confused with a horrendous press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3884.8s	3884.8	 conference, where he just put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3888.6s	3888.6	 Well, I think you said it, you know, the thing that he said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3891.2s	3891.2	 around, you know, I just want to thank the customers and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3894.0s	3894.0	 employees for paying for this. It sounded flippant. And it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3898.6s	3898.6	 didn't really acknowledge the incredible amount of heavy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3902.4s	3902.4	 lifting and hard work that he did acknowledge in the clip from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3905.2s	3905.2	 2000 on Charlie Rose, right. So if you if you actually played
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3908.8s	3908.8	 those two things back, back side by side, you'd say, is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3913.1s	3913.1	 the same person? One was thoughtful, extremely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3916.3s	3916.3	 respectful. The other one was now maybe he was just amped up. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3919.4s	3919.4	 mean, I could see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3920.0s	3920.0	 I think that's what I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3922.6s	3922.6	 cloud nine, so to speak, you know, and so and so he just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3925.6s	3925.6	 wasn't thinking about it. But you know, honestly, like, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3928.0s	3928.0	 he is smart enough. And that team is smart enough to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3930.6s	3930.6	 we're assuming you're coming back. So here's some fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3933.0s	3933.0	 talking points. Why don't you just look at those on the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3935.4s	3935.4	 down as you float down to earth. And let's just make sure we nail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3938.6s	3938.6	 this and put our best foot forward. That is where I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3941.5s	3941.5	 he probably has some regrets based on how people reacted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3944.7s	3944.7	 This Bezos spaceflight was a real Rorschach test because he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3948.6s	3948.6	 took heat from both the right and the left. But the criticism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3951.6s	3951.6	 was very different. You know, the critique I heard from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3954.8s	3954.8	 right was that he's having some sort of midlife crisis and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3958.5s	3958.5	 rocket looked too much like a phallus. Okay, fine, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3961.5s	3961.5	 That the criticism from the left was it had much more to do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3966.6s	3966.6	 a real contempt for private initiative and private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3969.6s	3969.6	 enterprise, you could almost see them being horrified and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3973.5s	3973.5	 dismay that you know, why was he doing this with his own money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3976.3s	3976.3	 You know, if this had been a NASA flight, I don't think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3979.0s	3979.0	 would have had a problem with it. And so you see here that even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3983.2s	3983.2	 though Bezos has been so much more effective using his own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3986.8s	3986.8	 money to do this, the left is reflexively hates that. And they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3994.4s	3994.4	 kept saying, well, how dare he use this money, the money could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=3997.1s	3997.1	 have been used on something else so much better. Well, what do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4000.6s	4000.6	 you think of that argument?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4001.9s	4001.9	 I think it's wrong in a couple of respects. It basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4004.3s	4004.3	 implies that the purveyors of these social programs are better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4008.0s	4008.0	 distributors of societal resources than our greatest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4011.6s	4011.6	 inventors. And I don't think that's true. You look at these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4014.5s	4014.5	 social programs, they want to keep doubling down on they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4017.4s	4017.4	 not working. You know, these programs are our policies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4020.8s	4020.8	 towards homelessness is not failing because of lack of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4022.9s	4022.9	 funding. There's a tremendous amount of funding. In San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4025.6s	4025.6	 Francisco, they're spending $60,000 per tent per year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4028.4s	4028.4	 they're spending $300,000 in social services per homeless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4031.4s	4031.4	 person per year, lack of funding is not the problem. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4034.2s	4034.2	 approach is the problem. We spend something like $25,000 per

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4040.3s	4040.3	 scores are going down. So you know, these people who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4044.0s	4044.0	 criticizing Bezos don't know what to do with the money. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4047.4s	4047.4	 don't know how to spend it any better. They're not good at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4049.9s	4049.9	 executing. However, Bezos or Elon, these are two of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4053.5s	4053.5	 greatest inventors, let them go, let them go because you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4057.3s	4057.3	 they are pushing the boundaries. And I do believe there will be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4060.6s	4060.6	 great engineering and scientific breakthroughs that come as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4064.2s	4064.2	 result of what they're doing with this new space race.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4067.3s	4067.3	 It's also super uninformed if correct me if I'm wrong here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4070.1s	4070.1	 but they were saying that the they should have been doing more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4073.2s	4073.2	 initiatives on Earth, if you actually and they were kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4075.6s	4075.6	 talking about climate change and the use of these fuels to get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4078.2s	4078.2	 space. And number one, the rocket ship fuel, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4082.3s	4082.3	 understanding in these is less than the what happens in a 747.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4086.3s	4086.3	 So put that aside. And then second, Elon has done more for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4090.9s	4090.9	 global warming with Tesla than anybody in the battery packs, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4094.3s	4094.3	 think in modern society, I can't think of somebody in the private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4097.8s	4097.8	 sector who's done more. And then has there ever been a gift?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4100.3s	4100.3	 There's never been a gift of $10 billion to one cause, let alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4104.9s	4104.9	 one cause which Bezos gave, which was climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4107.5s	4107.5	 Nobody, nobody has done more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4109.2s	4109.2	 So hasn't you would know Chamath, I thought Richard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4112.0s	4112.0	 Branson had done a lot for global warming. I thought he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4113.8s	4113.8	 very involved in the carbon credits space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4116.7s	4116.7	 I think that we're witnessing something that can best be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4120.8s	4120.8	 described as people who have reached a point in their life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4125.4s	4125.4	 where they've realized that they're impotent, getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4129.5s	4129.5	 incredibly angry at people who are willing to be wrong, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4134.1s	4134.1	 want to just have a chance to be on the field and try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4137.2s	4137.2	 And have the freedom to do so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4138.6s	4138.6	 And that just literally infuriates a certain class of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4142.3s	4142.3	 people. It proves itself out by what David said, we are not in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4146.5s	4146.5	 a funding crisis, we are running 10 $20 trillion deficits, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4151.7s	4151.7	 know, or sorry, 10, you know, hundreds of billions of dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4154.7s	4154.7	 deficits, 10 $20 trillion debt levels that are increasing every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4158.0s	4158.0	 year. We have a surfeit of money. We print money whenever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4163.1s	4163.1	 we want. We don't have a shortage of money. We have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4166.0s	4166.0	 shortage of capable people who know what to do with that money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4169.9s	4169.9	 And in the absence of people being able to do things, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4174.2s	4174.2	 would rather other people not do things not because it's not the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4176.9s	4176.9	 right thing to do, but because it makes them feel impotent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4180.0s	4180.0	 Right. And so what is driving that? I think you there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4183.7s	4183.7	 real contempt for private initiative. And Jason, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4187.2s	4187.2	 right, you see it in the hatred towards Elon, nobody has done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4190.8s	4190.8	 more to actually reduce carbon emissions than Elon. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4195.3s	4195.3	 even the better end of story, period end of story. I mean, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4198.4s	4198.4	 Bezos gift to some philanthropy, I don't know if that's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4200.9s	4200.9	 make a difference or not. You're right that he's putting his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4204.3s	4204.3	 money where his mouth is on that issue. But it's indisputable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4208.0s	4208.0	 that Elon, the electric car industry would not exist without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4212.0s	4212.0	 Elon. And yet there is contempt and hatred for the fact that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4215.7s	4215.7	 did this through private initiative. If the government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4218.1s	4218.1	 he does it in a way that is not checking the boxes for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4224.0s	4224.0	 cohort of people who feel incredibly insecure and fragile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4228.3s	4228.3	 emotionally. They don't like that he says what he wants. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4232.2s	4232.2	 don't like that he does what he wants. They don't like that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4234.8s	4234.8	 dresses the way he does. They don't like any of it because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4237.6s	4237.6	 it's not conformist enough. It's not about the look people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4240.9s	4240.9	 It's also about the money that it's the wealth that's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4243.2s	4243.2	 accumulated to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4244.1s	4244.1	 well, no, no, hold on. I don't think that's what it is at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4246.2s	4246.2	 No,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4246.5s	4246.5	 I actually think what it is, is psychological. It is nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4249.8s	4249.8	 about money. I think what we are witnessing, and I think social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4252.9s	4252.9	 media has just blown the cover off it is a psychological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4256.7s	4256.7	 awakening that people have, which is that they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4260.3s	4260.3	 comfortable, knowing that there was a class of insiders, and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4264.9s	4264.9	 huge cohort of outsiders, and they just believe the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4268.7s	4268.7	 would function as it should. Now you see people migrating through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4272.4s	4272.4	 this membrane, achieving enormous amounts of success,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4276.2s	4276.2	 basically eclipsing every single insider possible by orders of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4279.3s	4279.3	 magnitude. And it breaks people's brains because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4283.0s	4283.0	 don't like it because now they think, why didn't happen to me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4286.7s	4286.7	 Why not me? And the thing is, because you're not capable and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4290.7s	4290.7	 at some were along the way working, you're not dedicated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4293.3s	4293.3	 you didn't try or you didn't try. They didn't act with agency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4297.3s	4297.3	 I mean, look, every day, every day, the greatest thing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4300.8s	4300.8	 I've learned about the public markets now, having been, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4303.9s	4303.9	 know, purely on the early stage technology side building,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4307.5s	4307.5	 running, then investing, is I get a mark every day, right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4311.5s	4311.5	 to do both businesses, I get a scorecard every day. And some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4315.2s	4315.2	 days, I really think to myself, maybe I'm just not good enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4318.7s	4318.7	 today. And I say to myself, that is true today. And then the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4324.3s	4324.3	 difference is tomorrow, I have a choice, which is I wake up and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4327.1s	4327.1	 decide, am I going to go back at it or not? And I'm not game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4331.2s	4331.2	 And I'm not going to hate on other people who had a good day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4334.8s	4334.8	 today, just because I had a bad day. And that's what I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4339.1s	4339.1	 we're going through. We're going through and social media allows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4341.6s	4341.6	 it to happen. And it allows you to put it out there. You can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4344.6s	4344.6	 hide behind a screen name, you can basically say whatever you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4347.7s	4347.7	 want to vent this pent up frustration, journalists doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4353.3s	4353.3	 it. Of course, of course, because journalists are doing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4356.9s	4356.9	 too, they're just so bitter that they feel dunking on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4361.4s	4361.4	 greatest inventors of our time is a productive use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4364.6s	4364.6	 The difference is, journalists do it with a real screen name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4367.6s	4367.6	 under the guise of journalism. Everybody else does it with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4370.2s	4370.2	 fake screen name. And it's all just a bunch of trolling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4373.0s	4373.0	 In order to do something really great, like Bezos or like Elon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4376.0s	4376.0	 you have to believe that you have agency over your own life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4379.6s	4379.6	 You have to believe that you can accomplish great things. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4382.4s	4382.4	 have to, you know, act with with purpose. And is that really what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4386.2s	4386.2	 we're teaching kids today in schools, what we're teaching them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4389.8s	4389.8	 is they're either victims or oppressors at some intersectional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4393.1s	4393.1	 framework. We're not teaching them about earned success, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4396.8s	4396.8	 teaching them about privilege, which is, you know, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4399.6s	4399.6	 presumptively ill gotten. And it's all about a transference of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4404.2s	4404.2	 privilege. And, and basically money from people who are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4409.9s	4409.9	 oppressors in this framework to people who are victims. But no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4413.1s	4413.1	 one's talking about how you actually create change and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4416.6s	4416.6	 success. Abundance, right? Abundance. It's all a negative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4420.2s	4420.2	 sum. It's always a negative sum game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4422.0s	4422.0	 Freebird, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4422.8s	4422.8	 I dated all back to the Kim Kardashian sex tape. I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4426.8s	4426.8	 that there was this moment where someone who was didn't do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4430.5s	4430.5	 anything, didn't have a career wasn't doing anything workwise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4433.6s	4433.6	 but was kind of a pseudo celebrity for being a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4436.2s	4436.2	 celebrity. It's like the Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie era,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4439.2s	4439.2	 right? Like, folks who don't really have much to talk about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4443.6s	4443.6	 except that they're the ones that people are talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4446.7s	4446.7	 And then that sex tape turned her into a superstar. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4450.2s	4450.2	 she became a billionaire a few years later. And so, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4454.4s	4454.4	 there, there, there is this kind of poignant moment, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4457.6s	4457.6	 where folks are like, wait a second, you don't have to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4461.3s	4461.3	 anything to get really rich in this country. You don't have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4463.9s	4463.9	 do anything to achieve all this fame. Therefore, the, the kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4467.6s	4467.6	 of assumption is, hey, you know what, there are people that just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4470.9s	4470.9	 get stuff and get to do what they want to do. And the rest of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4474.1s	4474.1	 us don't. And I do think that social media is the magnifying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4478.2s	4478.2	 glass that takes those those moments and makes them very big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4482.2s	4482.2	 and kind of then that becomes the assumed standard. When the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4484.8s	4484.8	 reality is, I mean, all four of us worked really fucking hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4489.2s	4489.2	 All four of us came from nothing. I don't know about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4491.8s	4491.8	 sex, but I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4494.0s	4494.0	 that was an immigrant doctor from South Africa and he moved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4496.5s	4496.5	 to the South as a Jew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4498.3s	4498.3	 I'm just joking. I mean, I think all of us graduated college
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4502.2s	4502.2	 deeply in debt. And then we all worked our way out of debt. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4505.7s	4505.7	 we all found ways to work really hard and find opportunities for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4509.6s	4509.6	 ourselves in this incredible country, and to build value and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4513.1s	4513.1	 to build businesses, it can't be done to realize those returns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4515.8s	4515.8	 And we don't start out as elites. We were never elite. We were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4519.6s	4519.6	 always the struggling, you know, immigrant entrepreneurs that got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4524.4s	4524.4	 ourselves to where we are because we clawed and we pushed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4527.3s	4527.3	 and we fought and we had grit and we had determination and we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4529.6s	4529.6	 had smarts and we had put in the effort. And I think that that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4533.0s	4533.0	 not really and so did Bezos and so did Elon. And I don't think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4537.0s	4537.0	 that there is any standard of elitism that endowed in them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4540.4s	4540.4	 like maybe in the days of the British monarchy, these kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4544.4s	4544.4	 inalienable rights to have the freedom that they have. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4548.1s	4548.1	 think that that and I think that that's so important because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4550.2s	4550.2	 people miss that point. And they think that Kim Kardashian, or the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4553.8s	4553.8	 random bolt of lightning or the elite is that the kind of endowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4557.6s	4557.6	 upon people in a way that's unfair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4559.7s	4559.7	 They're misreading the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4561.5s	4561.5	 Everyone else is missing out. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4563.4s	4563.4	 They misread the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4565.0s	4565.0	 So a couple things. Kim Kardashian may have gotten some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4568.5s	4568.5	 initial fame because of her sex tape, but fuck if she's not an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4571.6s	4571.6	 incredible business person, because from there to now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4574.6s	4574.6	 that's execution. Totally. There's a lot of there's a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4577.2s	4577.2	 toiling hard work, good decision making. She fucking nailed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4581.6s	4581.6	 Was I lucky to have actually joined Facebook versus my space?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4585.2s	4585.2	 Yes. But when I was there, did I fucking hit the cover off the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4588.5s	4588.5	 ball? Goddamn, yes. You know, was I lucky to have started social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4592.9s	4592.9	 capital and be able to raise capital? Sure. But then did I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4595.9s	4595.9	 have to help find a team, coach that team work with them make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4599.6s	4599.6	 good investments? That's fucking hard. And I think what people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4603.4s	4603.4	 forget is that this takes a lot of hard work, that there's all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4607.5s	4607.5	 kinds of levels of success, that you can be proud of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4610.7s	4610.7	 kinds of different accomplishments. What I loved is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4612.6s	4612.6	 when Friedberg used us and Elon and Bezos in the same sentence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4617.4s	4617.4	 because I catch myself where I'm ashamed sometimes from like, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4621.2s	4621.2	 am not as good as those two guys. So how dare I use my name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4625.6s	4625.6	 in the same sentence as their name. And then I think, wait a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4628.2s	4628.2	 minute, what the fuck am I quibbling over? Like, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4630.8s	4630.8	 insane in any way, shape or form, we've all made it sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4634.2s	4634.2	 there's different degrees, but it's beyond that it matters at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4636.9s	4636.9	 this point. And this is what I think we're living in a society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4640.2s	4640.2	 where it really distorts you. So if how do we change it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4643.4s	4643.4	 Chamath? How do we change people from thinking that it's random
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4646.5s	4646.5	 and that you can't do it because there are people who are no it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4649.5s	4649.5	 is random, but there are a group of people who believe the system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4652.4s	4652.4	 is rigged, I cannot become Chamath and I'm stuck in a rut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4656.5s	4656.5	 and I can't get out. I can't get out. How do we change that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4658.9s	4658.9	 belief, the whiners and the complainers and the haters are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4661.6s	4661.6	 stuck in a massive rut. And I think the thing that happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4665.2s	4665.2	 that I said it last pod, I'll say it again, maybe I'll just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4667.6s	4667.6	 say it every fucking pod. It is not about winning and losing. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4671.6s	4671.6	 is about trying and learning. And that is a huge thing. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4676.3s	4676.3	 about a learning mindset. It's about this idea that things are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4680.8s	4680.8	 changing so fucking fast. The only thing that I can do to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4685.4s	4685.4	 safe is to learn how to learn because things will constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4689.2s	4689.2	 be changing underfoot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4690.6s	4690.6	 But what do you say to the single mother with three kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4694.0s	4694.0	 who who is in a town where the factory is shutting down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4697.7s	4697.7	 she's losing her job and she doesn't have the resources to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4700.2s	4700.2	 move. She is not the person that hates Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4703.9s	4703.9	 I will fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4704.5s	4704.5	 bet two dollars. Aren't there institutional ruts in the United
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4708.0s	4708.0	 States? Yeah, I understand. These are two completely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4710.6s	4710.6	 topics. My point is, if you go online, it is filled with a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4717.2s	4717.2	 cohort of people that are positive. And then a large
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4720.6s	4720.6	 cohort of people that are silently trying to just gain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4723.6s	4723.6	 information out and a small vocal minority of bitter people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4727.7s	4727.7	 who can't do shit. And all I'm talking about is people. Well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4731.8s	4731.8	 who knows if they're privileged, but I'm just saying they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4733.8s	4733.8	 here getting paid 100,000 to work at the Atlantic. I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4736.7s	4736.7	 think that these people have been checkboxes their whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4739.0s	4739.0	 lives. They tried to play the team sports they were told to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4742.2s	4742.2	 they went to the schools they tried to do the the CFA the NBA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4746.1s	4746.1	 the this or the that nothing worked for them. They work in an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4749.5s	4749.5	 environment where they don't feel any equity. Actually, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4754.2s	4754.2	 is where equity is important. They feel disenfranchised and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4758.2s	4758.2	 they're angry. And as a result, they just want everything to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4762.1s	4762.1	 different so that nobody wins because they can't win. But if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4765.7s	4765.7	 they were winning, they would be the first one to say shut the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4767.9s	4767.9	 fucking door behind me. I'm convinced of it 100% the irony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4772.6s	4772.6	 is that the people you're talking about all went to these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4774.8s	4774.8	 elite institutions. And they imbibed these ideologies and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4780.2s	4780.2	 philosophies. And I think the people who have been successful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4784.9s	4784.9	 went to those not in all cases, but they went to those places
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4788.5s	4788.5	 and then rebelled against it or just shut it out. Here's what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4791.6s	4791.6	 should do. Here's what we should do. We should all contribute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4793.4s	4793.4	 five or 10 million bucks into a into an LLC. We should call
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4797.1s	4797.1	 Pegasus. We should use Pegasus to infiltrate all the fake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4801.3s	4801.3	 screen names on Twitter, and then index that to LinkedIn to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4804.8s	4804.8	 figure out where they all went to school and what they do and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4806.8s	4806.8	 just publish these database of all the haters. Well, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4810.0s	4810.0	 it's how funny would that be? I it's very interesting because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4814.2s	4814.2	 I'm watching a group of these complainers leave traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4818.9s	4818.9	 mainstream media because I'm focused on journalists because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4821.2s	4821.2	 was one and I'm watching them leave journalism, a small group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4825.2s	4825.2	 of them and become entrepreneurs on sub stack or their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4829.0s	4829.0	 products. And I feel like there's a little group of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4831.5s	4831.5	 who are realizing, Holy shit, I can make a million dollars. If I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4834.2s	4834.2	 apply myself and I quit the New York Times and I go start my own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4836.8s	4836.8	 publication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4837.5s	4837.5	 right. And I actually say something interesting and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4839.7s	4839.7	 differentiated not just towing the party line at the New York
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4842.2s	4842.2	 Times. There's a whole little there's a little crack here in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4845.6s	4845.6	 this. I'll say I'll say they are just as successful as Elon Musk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4849.4s	4849.4	 and Jeff Bezos. The the financial quantum may be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4854.5s	4854.5	 different. But I bet you the personal fucking satisfaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4857.6s	4857.6	 quantum is the same. And this is the key. This is the key. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4861.7s	4861.7	 could be running a $500,000 a year business. And you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4865.2s	4865.2	 feel like a million fucking bucks. You have a nice house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4869.7s	4869.7	 No nice family. You employ a couple people you provide a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4873.4s	4873.4	 life. You do what you want to do when you want to do it. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4876.7s	4876.7	 sense of freedom that comes with that and power and agency is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4882.4s	4882.4	 same as them. And maybe in some ways, the super richest guys in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4885.4s	4885.4	 the world actually have less agency than these guys would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4888.5s	4888.5	 Because they're so, you know, scheduled and people are coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4892.0s	4892.0	 after them all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4893.0s	4893.0	 One of my big takeaways from being in the tech industry for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4895.8s	4895.8	 20 years is that if you're smart, hardworking and don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4899.5s	4899.5	 have behaviors that sabotage yourself, you will be successful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4903.0s	4903.0	 in this industry. You know, over two decades, I mean, I've just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4906.2s	4906.2	 seen not how could you not you have such tailwinds at your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4910.1s	4910.1	 There's so much value being created. We saw over the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4913.6s	4913.6	 year, more money more LP dollars have gone into venture capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4917.0s	4917.0	 by far than any other year and more money more returns is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4920.3s	4920.3	 coming out. That's why more money's going on the call when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4923.2s	4923.2	 you say anybody could be successful just by showing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4926.6s	4926.6	 And you said that but the first part is the critical part you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4929.6s	4929.6	 just said who are not prone to self sabotage. There is an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4932.9s	4932.9	 enormous number of people who are prone to self I was one I am
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4936.8s	4936.8	 still one. But I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4939.2s	4939.2	 sabotage yourself your ego, he blew up his firm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4943.6s	4943.6	 That's true. But I think he blew it up because there was creative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4947.3s	4947.3	 destruction. I think he wasn't enjoying it. And he needed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4949.7s	4949.7	 start out he talked about it publicly said it. But the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4953.1s	4953.1	 blowing up when how do you reconcile the blowing up of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4955.5s	4955.5	 firm Chamath, whatever number of years later, rebooting this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4959.1s	4959.1	 all old news. It's like, you know, the amount of success and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4962.0s	4962.0	 capital and money that we've made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4966.2s	4966.2	 is undisputable. And I've made it under all kinds of weather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4970.9s	4970.9	 conditions. So you know, it all kind of speaks for itself. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4973.7s	4973.7	 the problem is, again, if you ask an average person, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4977.3s	4977.3	 think they care. I don't think they know I don't think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4979.4s	4979.4	 have an opinion. If you ask some, you know, blithering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4982.9s	4982.9	 haters interested in how you reconcile or look back on it now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4986.2s	4986.2	 it's so much distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4987.0s	4987.0	 I'll tell you from an outside perspective, how I reconcile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4989.6s	4989.6	 Chamath decision there is I think that as you become more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4992.1s	4992.1	 successful, your tolerance for doing stuff you don't want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4995.7s	4995.7	 really goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4997.2s	4997.2	 It goes to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=4998.8s	4998.8	 It's about this got to a point where he didn't want to be doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5001.4s	5001.4	 any blew it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5002.2s	5002.2	 Zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5002.7s	5002.7	 By the way, that that that is a characterization as well that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5005.6s	5005.6	 know, sometimes in in your career, you have to make it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5009.1s	5009.1	 in your personal life, you have to make a tough decision. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5011.6s	5011.6	 there is no good outcome. There is no good way to find a way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5016.3s	5016.3	 do it. But there are these moments where you got a rock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5018.4s	5018.4	 falling on you from one side and a rock falling on you from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5020.5s	5020.5	 other side. And you're gonna have to make a tough decision to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5023.0s	5023.0	 get out of the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5023.7s	5023.7	 I said to myself a long time ago, that if I was ever lucky
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5027.6s	5027.6	 to actually be wealthy enough where my wealth would change by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5033.2s	5033.2	 meaningful amounts, every order of magnitude, I would do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5036.6s	5036.6	 something different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5039.4s	5039.4	 And so you know, you can do the fucking math. So there it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5044.7s	5044.7	 I it's interesting being friends with you and watching it. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5047.7s	5047.7	 then also, I hate to give any credit there it is, but being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5051.7s	5051.7	 friends with Phil Helmuth, and watching him set outrageous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5054.6s	5054.6	 goals for himself in poker. I just thought, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5057.5s	5057.5	 you got to set some outrageous goals for yourself. And that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5059.7s	5059.7	 how I sort of broke through as I just said, the minute that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5062.1s	5062.1	 realized one at everything I do, I want to be the largest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5064.6s	5064.6	 syndicate, the most Jason prolific investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5067.7s	5067.7	 The minute I realized that I was basically going to become, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5072.3s	5072.3	 know, a billionaire because of my Facebook stock, I fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5075.4s	5075.4	 quit. And the craziest thing about it is I left so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5078.7s	5078.7	 stock on the table. It's like two, $3 billion of fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5082.8s	5082.8	 stock, I couldn't care less. And then and then you know, once I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5087.0s	5087.0	 figured out that there was something that you can do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5089.3s	5089.3	 capital, that's even more meaningful than just investing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5091.9s	5091.9	 in companies at a small scale. But now you can, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5094.6s	5094.6	 control companies and really allocate and shape how economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5097.8s	5097.8	 flows, I made a different set of decisions. And now I'm here. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5100.5s	5100.5	 if I increase it by another order of magnitude, I'll make a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5103.2s	5103.2	 different set of decisions. And that's poorly understood by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5106.8s	5106.8	 folks, because again, it doesn't map into a worldview. But the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5109.4s	5109.4	 point is, it maps into something that keeps me whole and sane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5113.5s	5113.5	 And it allows me to not be zero sum about everybody else's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5116.5s	5116.5	 success. And that's what I think we need to teach people

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5124.0s	5124.0	 not self sabotaging yourself. David said it so well, you will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5127.6s	5127.6	 eventually be successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5129.2s	5129.2	 What have you learned, David? You know, in this next chapter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5132.1s	5132.1	 being an investor capital allocator?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5133.8s	5133.8	 You're that me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5135.1s	5135.1	 Yeah, David, you? Well, that's what I said. Yeah, no, it's what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5139.4s	5139.4	 I said. I mean, just well, I mean, the thing that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5142.8s	5142.8	 happening right now is just the tech economy keeps getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5145.3s	5145.3	 bigger and bigger. It's just an explosion. There's an explosion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5147.9s	5147.9	 in the number of unicorns, explosion of the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5150.2s	5150.2	 funding that's available explosion in the amount of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5152.6s	5152.6	 returns being generated. There are now so many VCs that VCs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5158.4s	5158.4	 are literally throwing money at people. I mean, any half decent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5162.2s	5162.2	 idea now gets funded. The idea that somehow this ecosystem is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5167.0s	5167.0	 elitist or exclusionary. It's absurd, right? I mean, you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5171.1s	5171.1	 got micro VCs now who you know, it has to go to Sand Hill Road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5174.5s	5174.5	 anymore, right? I mean, there are so many ways to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5176.8s	5176.8	 raise money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5177.6s	5177.6	 Road. It's a ghost town. Remember, traffic jam? I went I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5180.5s	5180.5	 went down there the other day. And there was no traffic jam. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5183.1s	5183.1	 was speaking at Stanford. And literally, I was like, I got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5185.7s	5185.7	 put 15 minutes into my drive to get through that Sand Hill Road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5188.4s	5188.4	 because it was that 830. Right, I zipped down Sand Hill Road to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5191.7s	5191.7	 Stanford. There was two cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5194.4s	5194.4	 The tech ecosystem is so osmotic. It's so permeable in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5198.9s	5198.9	 terms of allowing new people and in fact, it's sucking in all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5202.1s	5202.1	 the talent it can find because it can't hire enough people even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5205.8s	5205.8	 in the worst economic conditions. And yet, when it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5209.2s	5209.2	 comes to talking about social and political, talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5213.6s	5213.6	 opportunity and social and political terms, the only thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5216.6s	5216.6	 you ever hear is that, you know, the ecosystem is somehow elitist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5221.0s	5221.0	 or exclusionary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5222.0s	5222.0	 And that's old, that's old news that that might have been valid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5225.4s	5225.4	 1520 years ago. I know when I went to Sand Hill Road for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5228.6s	5228.6	 first time 1520 years ago, it was a bunch of white partners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5231.8s	5231.8	 who went to Stanford or had MBAs from, you know, Harvard, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5237.1s	5237.1	 that's not the case. Now it's a bunch of people with rolling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5239.3s	5239.3	 funds and micro vcs and syndicates totally and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5241.9s	5241.9	 everything in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5242.9s	5242.9	 You're so wrapped up in in being a social justice warrior that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5246.6s	5246.6	 you've just missed that there is like basically infinite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5249.9s	5249.9	 opportunity. You know, then it's on you, you're sabotaging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5253.5s	5253.5	 yourself. And then 510 years later, you're still stuck in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5256.3s	5256.3	 that role. And then you become bitter and then you become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5259.0s	5259.0	 bitter to Jamal's point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5260.1s	5260.1	 Freebrook, how hard was it for you to leave Google? And what was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5263.4s	5263.4	 that like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5264.3s	5264.3	 I was at Google for two and a half years. I had gone through I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5268.0s	5268.0	 joined before the IPO, I was like a couple hundred employees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5271.2s	5271.2	 just under 1000 employees. And then we went public. I got this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5274.5s	5274.5	 huge bonus from Sergey to stick around. When I was thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5279.7s	5279.7	 about leaving. I mean, for me, it was like, seven figures, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5283.7s	5283.7	 was. Yeah, it was a couple 1000 shares of stock. And like $250,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5290.1s	5290.1	 of cash. And I gave it up, you know, be worth a lot of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5294.8s	5294.8	 But I just felt like I learned so much at Google. And I had such
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5298.5s	5298.5	 an appreciation for the team there in the company. And by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5301.9s	5301.9	 way, I worked at Google. And all of a sudden, the company went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5304.4s	5304.4	 public and I could buy a house. I mean, it was an incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5306.5s	5306.5	 moment for me. And, and I suddenly felt what Jamal talked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5311.2s	5311.2	 about, which is this freedom in my life, suddenly, I had hit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5314.7s	5314.7	 that that that next plateau of wealth where I now had a couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5318.0s	5318.0	 $100,000 of net worth. And I could leave, or I guess I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5323.2s	5323.2	 over $1 million of net worth and I could now leave and go do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5325.7s	5325.7	 something I wanted to go do with my night, I had a couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5328.1s	5328.1	 $100,000. And I could go leave and do what I wanted to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5332.1s	5332.1	 which was to build my own business and have the freedom to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5334.6s	5334.6	 make decisions. And and so I honestly felt like really fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5340.5s	5340.5	 just leaving all that money behind I left, I left millions of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5343.2s	5343.2	 dollars behind. For when I left Google after being there for two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5346.6s	5346.6	 and a half years to start my company. And you know, it was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5350.3s	5350.3	 struggle, right? Like, I mean, as you guys know, building a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5352.0s	5352.0	 business, which I did from 2006 to 2013 was a nightmare. Every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5358.5s	5358.5	 day was a nightmare. I say, in entrepreneurs, and I've said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5362.3s	5362.3	 this publicly before, but it feels like every day, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5364.6s	5364.6	 taking a step backwards. And one out of five days, you take a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5367.6s	5367.6	 five step leap forward. So at the end of a week, you're one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5370.6s	5370.6	 step ahead of where you started. But your existential memory is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5373.6s	5373.6	 that you're failing every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5375.4s	5375.4	 every day, and suddenly you wake up and seven years have gone by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5378.4s	5378.4	 and you're like, oh, shit, we've got an amazing business. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5380.9s	5380.9	 someone wants to buy it for a billion dollars. And if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5383.6s	5383.6	 don't have the grit and the guts, and the determination to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5386.9s	5386.9	 push through those those daily battles and deal with that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5389.5s	5389.5	 that hardship, you know, and I don't think that being in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5393.2s	5393.2	 comfort of the big system of Google felt right for me. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5396.2s	5396.2	 think being in the playing field and battling it out every day is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5399.7s	5399.7	 right for me. And so it was the right it was the right call for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5403.1s	5403.1	 me, obviously it worked out. But you know, still, I make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5406.4s	5406.4	 choices in my life in terms of what do I want to do? Do I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5408.6s	5408.6	 to go live on a yacht or have some luxury or do whatever. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5411.5s	5411.5	 I prefer to just make great businesses and turn science into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5414.9s	5414.9	 into commercial opportunity. And that's how I do you ever and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5418.0s	5418.0	 just wanted to send this out to the whole panel. Do you ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5421.0s	5421.0	 think, you know, having hit the home runs, and having the cash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5425.3s	5425.3	 to literally retire at this age, and then just, you know, kite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5428.9s	5428.9	 board or do whatever. Do you ever think about retirement and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5432.6s	5432.6	 not going into work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5434.2s	5434.2	 Fuck no. Okay. Yeah. You want to do you feel you want to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5439.1s	5439.1	 harder? Yesterday? Yesterday, as an example, was an incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5443.2s	5443.2	 day, because I was able to bicycle with Nat and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5451.2s	5451.2	 youngest to go get a gelato. I had a kickoff meeting for I had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5457.1s	5457.1	 a kickoff meeting for a startup that's doing something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5460.2s	5460.2	 incredible in batteries. We're, you know, starting from scratch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5466.1s	5466.1	 series a co founders me and the other into the other director.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5473.2s	5473.2	 And we're starting literally starting and I remember the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5476.7s	5476.7	 feeling of having done this now 30 or 40 times and it's the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5480.1s	5480.1	 feeling.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5483.3s	5483.3	 And then I and then I had a call because I'm trying to put a you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5486.2s	5486.2	 know, more than a billion dollars to work in a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5488.6s	5488.6	 battery idea. And I thought to myself, God, I'm so fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5493.8s	5493.8	 lucky. And it's it was a grindy long day and I had never felt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5499.9s	5499.9	 more thankful. So why would I? And I don't know that I feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5505.1s	5505.1	 just so blessed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5507.2s	5507.2	 Sachs, you ever think about hanging up? Or are you more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5510.8s	5510.8	 motivated to go to work every day? Are you annoyed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5513.0s	5513.0	 Yeah, I mean, the thing that's giving me the most energy right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5515.6s	5515.6	 now is we're in a private beta on call in near this app that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5519.7s	5519.7	 incubated. And I mean, it's getting better. It's good. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5524.0s	5524.0	 getting better every day. And I'm really enjoying tinkering on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5526.8s	5526.8	 it. And I feel like you know, I've you know, it's kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5530.4s	5530.4	 a tinker, by the way, you're a good product. You're good. You're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5532.7s	5532.7	 good at tickling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5534.8s	5534.8	 You know, we tried to hire Sachs as VP of product at Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5538.1s	5538.1	 What? Yeah. What would that have paid him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5543.1s	5543.1	 I use 2000 Sachs. Probably billion. Right. Seven billions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5546.9s	5546.9	 probably. 2007. Not taking that gig. No, no, because I did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5551.3s	5551.3	 the hammer instead. And you know, Yammer was successful, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5553.7s	5553.7	 I got to be my own boss. And that was better. You know, so I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5556.9s	5556.9	 don't know if I probably wouldn't have made as much money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5558.6s	5558.6	 But look, I've done, like you guys, I've done made lots of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5563.0s	5563.0	 decisions that made me less money. If I just stayed at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5565.0s	5565.0	 PayPal for 20 years, my stock would have been worth many, many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5568.8s	5568.8	 billions, right? That's why I tell people, don't sell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5571.2s	5571.2	 everything. Let your winners ride at least partially. Yeah, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5575.0s	5575.0	 mean, look, my I was an investor in Facebook. If I just kept all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5577.8s	5577.8	 of that stock, that'd be worth a billion dollars today. So it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5581.2s	5581.2	 pretty crazy. Well, sell some just don't sell everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5584.9s	5584.9	 That's my new philosophy. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5586.3s	5586.3	 Just so your point about to your point about what gives me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5589.1s	5589.1	 enjoyment. I mean, I'm really having fun tinkering with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5592.4s	5592.4	 app. And you know what it's like, it's like, it's like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5595.4s	5595.4	 new season. If you're in like the NBA or something, it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5598.2s	5598.2	 can we make a championship run? Can we get one more ring?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5601.5s	5601.5	 You know, and so you're like, you know, it'd be like saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5604.5s	5604.5	 to somebody, hey, you already got, you know, to NBA, NBA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5613.6s	5613.6	 this league, while I'm young enough and healthy enough to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5616.7s	5616.7	 make a run at one more ring, how could you not want to do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAtPReTswZo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=94&t=5622.6s	5622.6	 You know, you got to go for it. I can see you are you're
