https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=50.8s	50.8	 Hey everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=51.8s	51.8	 Welcome to another episode of the all in podcast with us today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=55.0s	55.0	 The dictator himself Chamath Palihapiti and the rain man David Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=60.4s	60.4	 I'm Jay cow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=62.1s	62.1	 And the queen of Kenwa quit the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=65.1s	65.1	 Where's the queen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=66.1s	66.1	 He quit the show and then he quit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=69.0s	69.0	 So we're looking for a science person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=70.7s	70.7	 If you know anybody, email all science guy at the all in podcast.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=76.1s	76.1	 If you want to apply for the science position here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=78.3s	78.3	 No, he couldn't make it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=79.6s	79.6	 He was moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=80.6s	80.6	 He's moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=81.6s	81.6	 He's moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=83.3s	83.3	 I guess we can say that without invading his privacy, but he's not going to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=88.6s	88.6	 do a show anyway, because there's so much going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=91.7s	91.7	 And I think we should start with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=93.3s	93.3	 Do we want to start with the COVID stuff again for the third episode in a row?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=97.4s	97.4	 Or do you want to start with China and then back into COVID?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=99.5s	99.5	 Oh, fuck COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=100.5s	100.5	 I know we should just do COVID quickly because I think, you know, as much as the audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=105.3s	105.3	 complained about it, we got a lot of comments saying, why are you talking about COVID so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=108.2s	108.2	 much?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=109.2s	109.2	 We were ahead of the curve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=110.2s	110.2	 I'm predicting this whole new Delta wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=112.6s	112.6	 We told people it was coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=113.9s	113.9	 I think it was a useful service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=116.1s	116.1	 So people might not want to hear it, but it was, I think, I would say we're probably two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=119.9s	119.9	 weeks ahead of the national media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=122.2s	122.2	 I think that we've gotten a couple things actually right a couple weeks ahead of other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=126.8s	126.8	 people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=127.8s	127.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=128.8s	128.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=129.8s	129.8	 I mean, it was pretty obvious that this was going to race through the places that had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=134.0s	134.0	 low vaccination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=136.5s	136.5	 And having the breakthrough cases is, I don't think anybody anticipated that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=144.4s	144.4	 And the thing we didn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=145.8s	145.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=146.8s	146.8	 Over the last week on Twitter, I'm seeing this big debate on whether vaccinated people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=149.8s	149.8	 can spread the Delta variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=151.8s	151.8	 And I'm like, guys, didn't you see the show two weeks ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=154.1s	154.1	 We covered this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=155.1s	155.1	 Yeah, I got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=156.1s	156.1	 I was vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=157.1s	157.1	 I got it from someone who was vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=158.8s	158.8	 This is known, you know, Delta variant has slipped the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=163.0s	163.0	 It still prevents the most serious cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=166.0s	166.0	 Generally speaking, we need to see it as a spectrum of protection rather than completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=169.8s	169.8	 binary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=170.8s	170.8	 But yeah, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=172.7s	172.7	 You can get it and pass it on if you're vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=175.2s	175.2	 Like we know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=176.2s	176.2	 And we said we told the audience that three weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=178.9s	178.9	 The other thing we predicted was, you know, that this is going to be incredibly disruptive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=184.8s	184.8	 and it's going to create another debate of locked and potential lockdowns and mask mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=191.4s	191.4	 And most of all, we discussed and you know, we had a I think a pretty vibrant debate between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=196.4s	196.4	 all of us about under what circumstances does your decision to not get vaccinated impact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=201.6s	201.6	 everybody else vis-a-vis the petri dish of the next variant that's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=207.1s	207.1	 Hopefully that'll be less deadly, less contagious, which is tends to be how these things go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=213.4s	213.4	 But we also predicted some people are just going to start requiring vaccines, vaccine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=217.6s	217.6	 cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=219.0s	219.0	 What's happening in France and I don't know what examples you've seen this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=222.9s	222.9	 Yeah, I thought last week when you made vaccine passports, the main issue, I thought, well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=228.2s	228.2	 let's put it this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=229.2s	229.2	 I think that was actually turned out to be great moderation because what has been the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=232.1s	232.1	 big issue all over the world since the last episode vaccine passports, you saw it with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=237.0s	237.0	 Naftali Bennett in Israel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=239.4s	239.4	 They are not taking any of this vaccine hesitancy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=242.6s	242.6	 There's nine million people in that country, eight million are vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=244.9s	244.9	 They're telling the last million, you got to go get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=247.7s	247.7	 He has laid down the law saying enough is enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=250.3s	250.3	 A billion people have gotten vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=252.9s	252.9	 It works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=253.9s	253.9	 And for the last million of you who haven't gotten vaccinated, if you want to attend any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=258.3s	258.3	 function with more than a hundred people, if you want to go to synagogue, if you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=262.2s	262.2	 to go to a sports game, if you want to go to the mall, you have to be vaccinated or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=267.9s	267.9	 you are going to get tested that day at your own expense everywhere you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=272.6s	272.6	 It's going to be so they're going to make it a real pain in the ass until you get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=276.5s	276.5	 You then separately had Roger Goodell basically doing the same thing in the NFL saying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=282.7s	282.7	 players you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=283.7s	283.7	 Well, first of all, all the coaches have to get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=286.0s	286.0	 There was an anti-vax coach who got fired and then they don't have as much power with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=289.7s	289.7	 the players because the players have a union.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=291.5s	291.5	 But Goodell said to them, listen, if you don't get vaccinated, you're going to get tested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=296.8s	296.8	 every day that you go to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=298.5s	298.5	 And if the team, if there's an outbreak on the team and you guys miss a game, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=303.5s	303.5	 going to lose all of your salary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=305.1s	305.1	 We're not going to put up with apparently there's a game last year during the during
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=310.3s	310.3	 covid where it was a Ravens Steelers game and half of the one of those two, there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=318.4s	318.4	 the Ravens half of the first string was out with covid or they were in isolation protocol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=323.3s	323.3	 because they're around players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=324.3s	324.3	 You know, obviously, if you're in a locker room, one player gets everyone's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=327.6s	327.6	 be exposed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=328.6s	328.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=329.6s	329.6	 So it turned out to be like one of the worst games that the NFL put on last year and get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=334.3s	334.3	 all saying we're not going to put out product like that anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=336.8s	336.8	 If you are the reason why the team misses a game, guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=340.8s	340.8	 You and all of your teammates are going to lose your salary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=343.2s	343.2	 And since there's only 17 games in NFL season, you're talking about real, real money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=348.6s	348.6	 So you had Goodell doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=349.8s	349.8	 And now you have Facebook and Google basically coming out saying in order to go back to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=354.7s	354.7	 office, you have to be vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=356.4s	356.4	 Now, it's a little bit of the soft.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=358.7s	358.7	 It's sort of more of the iron fist beneath the velvet glove because they are offering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=362.3s	362.3	 testing. So if you don't get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=364.3s	364.3	 You can get a test every time you go to the office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=366.5s	366.5	 But unlike Israel, which is making you pay for it, you know, Facebook and Google are so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=370.8s	370.8	 rich, they're going to pay for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=371.8s	371.8	 So basically what you're seeing here is that government is not in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=376.3s	376.3	 Biden is not going to mandate federal workers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=380.4s	380.4	 Otherwise, you have to get tested weekly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=384.2s	384.2	 This is beyond now debatable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=388.0s	388.0	 I think the funny thing is the Republicans, I think, somewhere along the way realized, oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=391.7s	391.7	 my God, we're going to lose the midterm elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=393.7s	393.7	 They have found a way to find a single modality and behavior to steal defeat from the jaws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=400.4s	400.4	 of victory. You know, I think that the Republicans were probably trending to basically win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=405.3s	405.3	 back the House. And now I don't think that's the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=409.7s	409.7	 And you have a bunch of these red state governors who are literally flipping their shit right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=415.5s	415.5	 now, trying to figure out how to get their folks vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=419.3s	419.3	 Many of these people may not even be able to vote come midterms because they're either going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=423.1s	423.1	 to be dead or still sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=424.5s	424.5	 I mean, it's it's we've learned a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=429.7s	429.7	 And at this point, you're being left with folks there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=432.1s	432.1	 Again, there are people who do it for religious reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=434.6s	434.6	 I get it. There are people that are going to sort of like live off the grid and live by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=438.5s	438.5	 themselves. I get them, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=440.9s	440.9	 But the folks that want to be a tax on the system or use public resources, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=444.5s	444.5	 understand. And they're basically going to get singled out and discriminated against.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=449.1s	449.1	 And the carrot and the stick method here, I think, is going to work because we saw a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=454.2s	454.2	 bunch of people sign up to get vaccinated in France once they said, listen, you can't go to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=457.7s	457.7	 cafe or a bar. And I think that a lot of the people who are not vaccinated are probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=462.7s	462.7	 enjoying going out and having a life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=465.1s	465.1	 Danny Meyer, the restaurateur in New York from Union Square Cafe in Gramercy Tavern, one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=469.7s	469.7	 the most famous restaurateurs of all time, announced on CNBC this morning that he'll be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=474.3s	474.3	 requiring vaccines for all staff and customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=478.4s	478.4	 What do we think of that restaurant saying you've got to show a vaccine on the way in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=482.7s	482.7	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=484.0s	484.0	 Listen to me, if I'm going to go in and I'm going to spend two or three thousand dollars on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=487.9s	487.9	 wine and then a couple thousand bucks on a tip, I don't want some asshole who's going to get me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=493.0s	493.0	 sick there. It's bad enough that I still may get sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=496.1s	496.1	 And by the way, Danny Meyer's restaurants are not like, you know, fucking, you know, Red
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=501.1s	501.1	 Robin. These are extremely high places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=504.6s	504.6	 The idea that you can get a communicable respiratory disease and spend five thousand dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=510.5s	510.5	 is untenable, untenable, non-starter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=514.1s	514.1	 Sax, I mean, listen, you've you very interesting last episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=519.9s	519.9	 I felt like you were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=522.7s	522.7	 Really trying to balance your belief in freedom and people being able to make decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=527.8s	527.8	 themselves with, you know, the reality that we can't be close forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=532.9s	532.9	 How has the last week changed your thinking and what do you think of Danny Meyer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=536.8s	536.8	 Well, I like what Danny Meyer did in this sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=540.3s	540.3	 He wants to create a certain experience for his clientele.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=543.6s	543.6	 And he knows that his clientele are more likely to go dine in his restaurants if there is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=549.1s	549.1	 vaccine policy at his restaurants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=550.9s	550.9	 He's not setting a policy for the whole country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=552.9s	552.9	 He's setting it for his establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=555.7s	555.7	 He has every right to be able to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=558.2s	558.2	 And he believes that will help his bottom line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=560.7s	560.7	 And he's probably right about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=562.3s	562.3	 Similarly, Roger Goodell, same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=564.3s	564.3	 I mean, he took a tough line because he knows that if he wants the NFL to put out a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=569.0s	569.0	 product every week, they can't be canceling games because of covid outbreaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=573.9s	573.9	 You know, they can't have the first string players out with covid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=576.6s	576.6	 So he made a smart business decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=578.4s	578.4	 I think people should have the freedom and the right to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=581.5s	581.5	 Now, I still have let's call it a reservation about government requiring it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=588.6s	588.6	 not because I don't see the benefit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=590.1s	590.1	 I definitely see the health benefit, but just because I don't like giving government the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=594.4s	594.4	 power to stick a stick, a needle in your arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=598.8s	598.8	 If you're a government employee, I do think the government has added power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=603.1s	603.1	 We talked about this last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=604.3s	604.3	 They can make it a job requirement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=606.3s	606.3	 And, you know, what's interesting in California, California said if you're a state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=611.8s	611.8	 employee, you got to get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=613.3s	613.3	 But the one group they singled out were the teachers because Gavin Newsom has no guts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=619.7s	619.7	 to stand up the teachers union whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=621.3s	621.3	 And I find it so ironic that early in the pandemic, we had this big debate about whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=626.2s	626.2	 the teachers would go back to school in the fall and the teachers union said we won't go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=630.3s	630.3	 back unless we're first in line for the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=632.8s	632.8	 Well, guess what? They got that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=634.3s	634.3	 Now they're saying they're not going to go back if you make us get vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=637.0s	637.0	 I mean, you can't win with moving the goalposts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=640.1s	640.1	 I mean, people, they want to work from home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=643.5s	643.5	 They it's kind of ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=645.8s	645.8	 It's one group that needs to do it most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=647.5s	647.5	 And they should be the one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=648.6s	648.6	 It's kind of like the army and teachers and health care workers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=652.4s	652.4	 They should be given a mandate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=654.1s	654.1	 If you want this job, you must be vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=656.4s	656.4	 You cannot be in the army and the military and not be vaccinated because we need you in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=660.6s	660.6	 close quarters on a helicopter to go whack Osama bin Laden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=664.5s	664.5	 We can't have a covid outbreak in the Navy SEALs when we got to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=669.9s	669.9	 I'm OK with that. I think I think every employer has the right to require it if they believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=673.6s	673.6	 it's going to impact job performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=674.8s	674.8	 Now, I want to go back to the point that your mouth made about the midterm elections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=678.3s	678.3	 I because I there's a part I agree with and a part I disagree with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=681.3s	681.3	 So the part I agree with is that the Republicans were cruising to, you know, a midterm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=688.0s	688.0	 shellacking and now the the whole vaccine hesitancy issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=693.5s	693.5	 I think there was a prospect of that causing damage to the Republicans, not because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=699.6s	699.6	 most Republicans are vaccine hesitant, but rather because Republican politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=705.1s	705.1	 were not out front enough on getting vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=707.5s	707.5	 But look, there's a difference between reality and perception.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=709.7s	709.7	 Here's the reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=711.1s	711.1	 Every single Republican governor, every single one has been vaccinated and has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=716.2s	716.2	 supported the vaccine. Mitch McConnell is vaccinated, supports the vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=720.2s	720.2	 Kevin McCarthy put out a statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=721.7s	721.7	 You even have the House minority whip Scalise get vaccinated on on live TV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=727.5s	727.5	 Why had he not been vaccinated?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=728.8s	728.8	 Because he already had covid and he didn't actually think he needed it, but he got the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=731.4s	731.4	 vaccine anyway to basically double down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=734.0s	734.0	 You had Sarah Huckabee Sanders come out and say that she was getting the Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=738.4s	738.4	 She called it the Trump vaccine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=739.7s	739.7	 Yes, please. If they put the Trump logo on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=742.7s	742.7	 Right. I mean, she understands, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=744.5s	744.5	 Like this is probably, you know, Operation Light Speed or Warp Speed or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=749.6s	749.6	 was probably the biggest operation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=751.5s	751.5	 Operation Fuck Up the Midterms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=753.3s	753.3	 That's what the Republicans should call this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=754.9s	754.9	 Yeah. Well, so look, I mean, the Republican politicians in the main
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=759.1s	759.1	 support vaccines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=760.3s	760.3	 The problem is that they were being a little bit too quiet about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=763.4s	763.4	 As a result of that, you have the fringe people, the Marjorie Taylor Greens and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=767.9s	767.9	 forth. They were occupying too much airspace around this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=772.6s	772.6	 And, you know, frankly, you know, right now, I think that I think the Democrats are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=776.3s	776.3	 going to keep those. I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily go that far, but because I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=781.2s	781.2	 that I think the Republican problem was not that their vaccine hesitant, but rather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=785.9s	785.9	 that they were just being a little too quiet about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=789.4s	789.4	 But now I think that's changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=790.6s	790.6	 I mean, there is not a single major Republican politician who isn't strongly in favor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=795.2s	795.2	 of vaccine. If the Republicans can get their actual act together and actually get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=800.3s	800.3	 these, you know, Jason does joke about it, but I do think he's right in a certain way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=805.5s	805.5	 basically like this this group of Republicans largely who refuse to get vaccinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=811.1s	811.1	 then they may be able to pull something out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=812.7s	812.7	 But I think that it's going to have to require a little bit of backtracking and showing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=816.7s	816.7	 up, as you said, by the mainstream Republican political groups, and they just have not done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=821.2s	821.2	 a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=821.9s	821.9	 There's a really simple offering for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=824.0s	824.0	 New information, new strain, new approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=827.7s	827.7	 Listen, we didn't anticipate Delta would happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=830.4s	830.4	 This is 10 times more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=831.7s	831.7	 It allows people to save face, basically, as well as a face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=834.0s	834.0	 You got a perfect offer. And listen, there's new information here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=836.3s	836.3	 This thing is even the CDC hasn't officially changed their policy yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=840.4s	840.4	 I mean, it's coming, right? We know it's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=842.2s	842.2	 They've always been behind the curve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=843.6s	843.6	 We predicted the policy change on the show anywhere from two weeks to two months before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=848.4s	848.4	 they actually do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=850.2s	850.2	 But look, on the vaccine, I don't discern a difference in position on the vaccine itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=856.2s	856.2	 between Republican governors and Democrat governors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=858.8s	858.8	 They both are advocating it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=860.5s	860.5	 They're both allowing private organizations to require it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=863.7s	863.7	 But none of them, to my knowledge, have either had the guts or the temerity, however you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=870.1s	870.1	 want to see it, to actually require it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=871.8s	871.8	 Oh, I love that word temerity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=874.3s	874.3	 Not really used. Not used enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=876.4s	876.4	 And just putting a cap on this before we move on to what's going on in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=880.3s	880.3	 We talked about implementing this and how do you implement it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=883.9s	883.9	 Well, we don't need to have a national registry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=886.7s	886.7	 People have vaccine cards. You bring your vaccine card, you show it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=889.4s	889.4	 And then, of course, people go to, well, what happens if you create a faq?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=894.7s	894.7	 Can anybody create a fake vaccine card?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=897.0s	897.0	 Yes, of course you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=898.1s	898.1	 But the FBI has put out a statement now because of Lollapalooza, the music festival.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=905.6s	905.6	 They are saying do not buy a fake vaccine card because if you want to have no mask at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=910.1s	910.1	 Lollapalooza, you have to show your vaccine card.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=913.9s	913.9	 And they said the FBI is tweeting about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=918.6s	918.6	 It's illegal. It endangers yourself and those around you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=921.0s	921.0	 And it's a federal crime that could lead to hefty fines or prison time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=923.7s	923.7	 Oh, my God. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=925.2s	925.2	 So show us your papers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=927.7s	927.7	 Just get the vaccine and just get the vaccine, folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=930.3s	930.3	 Why are we still dealing with this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=932.1s	932.1	 Oh, my God. It's quickly becoming a Darwin Award.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=935.1s	935.1	 This is quickly moving into Darwin Award territory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=938.2s	938.2	 We are. I talked to my doctor and I was like, I want to get the Moderna or J&J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=941.7s	941.7	 Which one should I get? And they're like, you got the Pfizer already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=944.3s	944.3	 I'm like, I want to take a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=945.4s	945.4	 And they're like, I don't think that's going to make a difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=947.3s	947.3	 I was like, I think it's totally going to make a difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=948.7s	948.7	 This was like when we got off the pod last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=951.0s	951.0	 And they're like, yeah, I was like, well, just give me the third shot of Pfizer then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=953.5s	953.5	 And they're like, well, that's not necessary either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=955.1s	955.1	 I'm like, I don't care if it's not necessary. I want it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=957.6s	957.6	 Give me the third shot of Pfizer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=958.9s	958.9	 And then I open up Drudge Report yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=961.1s	961.1	 And it's like third shot of vaccine, Pfizer in Israel or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=964.7s	964.7	 They're just going to start giving people a third shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=966.5s	966.5	 Yeah, I just want to get ahead of the curve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=968.1s	968.1	 You're exactly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=969.4s	969.4	 But by the way, there's one other piece of news that came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=971.8s	971.8	 that I think is very positive on COVID, which is the availability of these oral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=976.2s	976.2	 antivirals, the pills that you can take when you get an early case of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=981.2s	981.2	 Right. So it's like what they have for Tamiflu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=983.5s	983.5	 With the flu, like no one should ever die of the flu because Tamiflu is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=986.9s	986.9	 like completely effective at stopping it, provided you take Tamiflu early in the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=992.0s	992.0	 So I think that, you know, with the reduced effectiveness of vaccine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=995.7s	995.7	 what we're going to have to do is supplement the vaccines and the boosters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=999.5s	999.5	 with home testing and then, you know, these oral antivirals so that you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 you, you take a test, you discover you got COVID and you immediately get prescribed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1008.9s	1008.9	 You know, one of these these pills and the pharma companies are coming out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1012.5s	1012.5	 There's like three different pharma companies coming out with these oral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1014.6s	1014.6	 and antivirals and then Freberg were here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1016.9s	1016.9	 He could tell us all about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1019.6s	1019.6	 Freberg explained the science behind this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1021.5s	1021.5	 You know what? The science can go fuck itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1023.3s	1023.3	 Hey, Danny Meyer, chill a great bottle of white burgundy because I'm coming, baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1027.0s	1027.0	 I'm vaccinated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1028.5s	1028.5	 Let's go, baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1029.5s	1029.5	 Vaccine ready to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1031.6s	1031.6	 Oh, my Lord. All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1034.3s	1034.3	 The China situation has been perplexing to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1037.9s	1037.9	 You know, my position was always be careful working in China
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1042.2s	1042.2	 or investing in China or investing in Chinese companies because they could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1045.8s	1045.8	 change the rules at any time and change the rules they have in the past year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1050.1s	1050.1	 We talked about, obviously, and financial and Jack Ma going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1054.9s	1054.9	 MIA by dance, a CEO and founder stepping down as CEO amid Chinese regulations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 and all the scrutiny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1062.8s	1062.8	 And then we have Didi last week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1067.3s	1067.3	 being pulled from the app store in an unprecedented penalty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1071.7s	1071.7	 where you're not allowed to download Didi and the existing users can use it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1076.5s	1076.5	 And then on top of that, all the educational companies this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1081.0s	1081.0	 were told that they cannot operate as for profit companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1086.1s	1086.1	 And these companies have gone public in Hong Kong and in the West.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1090.1s	1090.1	 And this has caused such an acute effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1092.1s	1092.1	 SoftBank is clearing a bunch of its Uber position to cover their losses in Didi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1099.0s	1099.0	 And then there is the story of Larry Chan, who is a Chinese education entrepreneur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1103.2s	1103.2	 He was worth 15 billion in January.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1105.3s	1105.3	 Now he's lost 99 percent of his net worth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1107.9s	1107.9	 According to Bloomberg, he founded Gautu Tei Chi Do or Tech Chi Do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1114.1s	1114.1	 which is a Chinese online tutoring firm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1115.8s	1115.8	 As we know, education is huge in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1120.7s	1120.7	 That company, Gautu, peaked at $142 a share in January
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1125.5s	1125.5	 and has fallen to $3 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1129.0s	1129.0	 Big sordid story there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1130.3s	1130.3	 Tencent lost 100 billion in market cap in three days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1134.1s	1134.1	 earlier this week as China cracked down on what they called a monopoly on music rights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1138.3s	1138.3	 So while we debate what happens with the monopolies here in the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1141.6s	1141.6	 China just literally told them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1143.8s	1143.8	 And here's the quote from the BBC article.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1146.1s	1146.1	 The company and its affiliated businesses have been told that they can no longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1149.0s	1149.0	 engage in exclusive deals over music rights and must dissolve any existing agreements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1153.0s	1153.0	 within 30 days. I mean, this would be like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1155.1s	1155.1	 Biden just saying the app store is now open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1157.8s	1157.8	 You have to let other app stores in Apple or, you know, just coming down and saying to Amazon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1162.6s	1162.6	 you can't sell Amazon Basics anymore in 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1164.9s	1164.9	 No more Amazon Basics at the site. What do we what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1168.7s	1168.7	 The end game is here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1171.0s	1171.0	 Is this a because China seems like they are very deliberate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1174.2s	1174.2	 and they plan in centuries. What is happening here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1176.8s	1176.8	 There's the short term and the long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1179.5s	1179.5	 I think what's happening in the short term is that the same thing that we are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1184.5s	1184.5	 talking about in the United States that Sax is, you know, very eloquently, basically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1190.1s	1190.1	 I think led most everybody in just really framing for a lot of people is this idea that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1195.7s	1195.7	 you know, we have privatized free speech and we have put the distribution of information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1200.7s	1200.7	 into the hands of three or four founder CEO oligarchs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1205.5s	1205.5	 That's also true in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1207.2s	1207.2	 And when you look under the hood of the major internet companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1210.0s	1210.0	 there's four or five guys that are in charge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1212.6s	1212.6	 And so I think that in the United States, politicians feel increasingly uneasy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1219.2s	1219.2	 with those folks having power because it's applied indiscriminately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1223.2s	1223.2	 Trump gets banned. Trump may not get banned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1225.3s	1225.3	 This person gets distribution. This article is considered misinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1228.8s	1228.8	 That article is considered disinformation. This article is suppressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1232.4s	1232.4	 It's a dangerous place to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1235.1s	1235.1	 And in China, they were just like enough's enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1237.1s	1237.1	 So I think the short term as it relates to the internet companies was basically a realization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1241.4s	1241.4	 that we are not going to allow any more devolution of power from the Chinese Communist Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1247.1s	1247.1	 to and into the hands of these internet entrepreneurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1249.8s	1249.8	 So that was that was sort of like the move out of fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1253.5s	1253.5	 They're scared. They're going to lose their power base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1255.4s	1255.4	 Not scared. I think they're just smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1257.3s	1257.3	 And they were like, we're not going to allow this to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1259.9s	1259.9	 So they don't have to deal with Section 230 or any law like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1263.5s	1263.5	 I think it was just a realization that we want them to understand who was boss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1268.9s	1268.9	 Right. And so there was a wave of resignations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1271.7s	1271.7	 There was now all of this market cap upheaval.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1275.1s	1275.1	 And this is now where we get to sort of like the appetizer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1278.7s	1278.7	 And I think in the appetizer, what they're basically saying is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1281.9s	1281.9	 we will control how money is made and who makes money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1287.7s	1287.7	 And I think that that sets up the really difficult thing that I think happens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1291.4s	1291.4	 which is about the long term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1292.6s	1292.6	 So in this in this thing, what's happening right now is China very firmly telling everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1298.2s	1298.2	 we are firmly in control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1299.8s	1299.8	 There is no private market and there is no capital market without our approval.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1306.9s	1306.9	 And that's a really big statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1309.5s	1309.5	 And in fact, it was such a big statement that I think the Chinese security authorities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1314.3s	1314.3	 and had like a conference call in Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all these folks were invited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1318.3s	1318.3	 And, you know, the vice chairman basically, his quote was something to the effect of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1321.9s	1321.9	 we promise that any more changes will at least let you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1325.8s	1325.8	 Not, hey, there's nothing nothing to see here or there's nothing more to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1330.0s	1330.0	 It's just more that as we decide new rules, we'll make sure that we give you guys enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1334.0s	1334.0	 warning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1334.7s	1334.7	 So it's very much firmly saying we know exactly how money is made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1339.3s	1339.3	 We will decide who makes money in what way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1341.7s	1341.7	 And we're going to make sure that, you know, all of this wealth creation happens under
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1347.4s	1347.4	 terms that we define.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1348.6s	1348.6	 And I think that the setup for the long term, the long term in China is complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1352.8s	1352.8	 It is an enormous demographic time bomb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1355.5s	1355.5	 We've talked about this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1356.8s	1356.8	 By the end of 2100, China's population will shrink from 1.1, 1.2 billion people down to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1362.3s	1362.3	 about 700 million people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1364.6s	1364.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1364.8s	1364.8	 So they had very progressive, quote unquote, under their framework, laws of one child policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1371.6s	1371.6	 to basically make it economically viable in the 60s and 70s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1375.3s	1375.3	 There was such a number of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1377.8s	1377.8	 Those people were able to get great jobs in the 80s and 90s and 2000s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1383.5s	1383.5	 And now they've realized, oh, wow, we made a huge miscalculation because now there is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1387.9s	1387.9	 just not enough people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1389.7s	1389.7	 And so China is going to shrink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1391.9s	1391.9	 And I think that, honestly, I think Xi Jinping probably thinks the simplest way to solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1396.7s	1396.7	 this is to basically nationalize a lot of the economy over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1399.9s	1399.9	 And so if I was a betting man, which I am general, but I'm not in China because I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1404.5s	1404.5	 don't understand the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1405.6s	1405.6	 It's super complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1406.6s	1406.6	 It's a great casino.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1407.1s	1407.1	 It's a stupid place to bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1408.5s	1408.5	 I'm not going to say that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1409.3s	1409.3	 I just think that I don't know the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1412.3s	1412.3	 Well, I think that they change the rules of the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1415.1s	1415.1	 Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1415.3s	1415.3	 Let me just finish what I'm saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1416.6s	1416.6	 I think that what we're starting to see is the beginning of nationalizations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1422.4s	1422.4	 And I think it's going to start in technology universe because those are the critical assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1427.9s	1427.9	 that the Chinese need to own for the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1429.7s	1429.7	 So that's, in my opinion, what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1431.3s	1431.3	 I think it's really important what's going on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1435.3s	1435.3	 And, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1436.6s	1436.6	 Sax, when you look at this, we've been talking about, you know, this, these two great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1440.8s	1440.8	 competitors, America and China, and who's going to win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1444.1s	1444.1	 How does China win?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1446.3s	1446.3	 If this would seem not having a vibrant entrepreneurial, you know, socialist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1453.6s	1453.6	 communist hybrid, is this the end of that experiment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1457.0s	1457.0	 And now it's just going to go all national.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1458.7s	1458.7	 And then that doesn't make it easier for the West to win if China is just going to say we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1463.8s	1463.8	 going to operate everything and they don't have a competition of ideas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1467.9s	1467.9	 If they go that far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1468.8s	1468.8	 I think it's really interesting actually to compare what's happening in China with what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1472.6s	1472.6	 happening in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1474.1s	1474.1	 Because on the surface, both countries are having this debate about whether big tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1478.7s	1478.7	 needs to be reined in, broken up, controlled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1481.4s	1481.4	 We're having that debate in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1482.7s	1482.7	 And obviously they're having some version of it in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1485.1s	1485.1	 But it's a little bit like the civil rights debate, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1489.1s	1489.1	 Where, you know, we have our civil rights issue in the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1491.8s	1491.8	 And, you know, they have Shenzhen, you know, they have the Uyghurs, you know, it's like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1496.9s	1496.9	 whole order of magnitude different in terms of the way they react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1501.0s	1501.0	 And I think there's I would say there's three main differences here between the Chinese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1506.3s	1506.3	 approach and the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1508.0s	1508.0	 approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1508.3s	1508.3	 Number one, data privacy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1511.1s	1511.1	 We have a concept of separation between private companies and the data they control and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1517.5s	1517.5	 data that the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1518.4s	1518.4	 Government can get its hands on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1519.7s	1519.7	 And the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1520.2s	1520.2	 Government typically has to get a warrant and go through a court proceeding to get that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1524.0s	1524.0	 data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1524.3s	1524.3	 What China is doing, they've now passed a law basically saying to all these companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1528.7s	1528.7	 your data belongs to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1530.1s	1530.1	 If we want it, we get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1531.5s	1531.5	 They're taking operational control over the data and you know they're going to use it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1535.1s	1535.1	 OK, that's a big difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1536.8s	1536.8	 Number two, I think that China seems to be worried about these big tech companies, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1543.7s	1543.7	 just in terms of whether they might engage in anti-competitive practices or consumer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1550.3s	1550.3	 harm, sort of those conventional antitrust concepts in the United States, but they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1554.5s	1554.5	 concerned about these big tech moguls becoming power centers in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1559.9s	1559.9	 And you saw this with Jack Ma, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1561.8s	1561.8	 I mean, clearly the CCP had a problem with the way that Jack Ma had become a figure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1567.3s	1567.3	 that people rallied around him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1568.8s	1568.8	 They looked to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1569.5s	1569.5	 They cared about what he had to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1571.2s	1571.2	 And all of a sudden, yes, the ant IPO was put on hold, but it was more than that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1576.5s	1576.5	 This was not just like what the SEC would have done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1579.3s	1579.3	 All of a sudden, Jack Ma disappears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1580.9s	1580.9	 He goes into some sort of house arrest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1582.7s	1582.7	 He comes out three months later looking kind of emaciated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1587.1s	1587.1	 They are putting the fear of God in these big tech moguls in a way that we would never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1591.9s	1591.9	 do in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1592.7s	1592.7	 I mean, look, I don't want Tim Cook to engage in anti-competitive practices, but I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1597.0s	1597.0	 want anything bad happening to Tim Cook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1598.6s	1598.6	 I don't think the guy should be under house arrest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1600.4s	1600.4	 If he wants to donate his money to political causes and speak out as a private citizen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1604.7s	1604.7	 he has every right to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1605.9s	1605.9	 And I'll defend his right to do that, no matter how much I want Apple to be reigned in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1611.0s	1611.0	 They don't have that, again, that separate concept in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1615.1s	1615.1	 And I think the last thing that's going on here that's different is you saw China put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1619.6s	1619.6	 the kibosh on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1620.6s	1620.6	 There are 34 IPOs of major Chinese tech companies that were scheduled to IPO in US markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1628.2s	1628.2	 They have sort of shut that pipeline down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1630.7s	1630.7	 And what they appear to be saying is that we've talked about reshoring strategic industries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1637.7s	1637.7	 back to the US, like pharmaceutical manufacturing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1640.3s	1640.3	 They seem to be saying, we are going to reshore the IPO business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1644.0s	1644.0	 We do not want you, big Chinese tech companies, IPO-ing on American markets, on American
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1650.4s	1650.4	 exchanges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1651.2s	1651.2	 We are bringing that business back to China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1653.5s	1653.5	 And that is why I think you're seeing giant ripple effects now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1657.5s	1657.5	 Because to Chumas' point about decoupling, we now, it looks like, are going to be decoupling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1663.8s	1663.8	 our financial markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1665.2s	1665.2	 And that's why you're seeing gigantic hits to the valuations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1670.2s	1670.2	 That's a... Would you agree with me that the decoupling of these financial markets might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1674.6s	1674.6	 be in the best interest of humanity and ultimately the decoupling of these two economies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1680.3s	1680.3	 If we don't see eye to eye about human rights and how to treat people, maybe it's good that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1685.2s	1685.2	 we have a little more distance between the two markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1688.7s	1688.7	 It's hard to know if engagement is the better process, but it doesn't seem like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1692.6s	1692.6	 the Chinese Communist Party wants to have anything to do with democracy, anything to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1697.5s	1697.5	 do with free markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1698.6s	1698.6	 They want to control all the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1700.9s	1700.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1701.4s	1701.4	 You could see... But in a way, the product that the US was exporting to China was our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1708.9s	1708.9	 financial markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1710.3s	1710.3	 And I think a good way, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1712.7s	1712.7	 So I think the bad version of this is when China is able to buy up ownership in critical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1719.3s	1719.3	 strategic centers in the US and that affects people's speech rights over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1722.7s	1722.7	 But this is not China buying up ownership in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1726.3s	1726.3	 This was China acting as a consumer of US financial markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1731.0s	1731.0	 And I think it's different, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1733.5s	1733.5	 When we're selling products over there, that helps correct our trade balance, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1737.2s	1737.2	 This is why I don't have a problem with Elon selling cars over in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1740.9s	1740.9	 He's helping our trade balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1744.7s	1744.7	 But they're kind of canceling that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1745.9s	1745.9	 They're kind of saying, we're going to reshore this industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1748.2s	1748.2	 We want to have a domestic stock market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1752.1s	1752.1	 This is creating a mono economy, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1755.2s	1755.2	 It's like it's going to blur the lines between public and private ownership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1760.7s	1760.7	 And it's going to basically make it one huge pot from which the Chinese government
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1768.2s	1768.2	 can take and put it back into as it deems fit for the broader success of China as a whole,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1774.7s	1774.7	 right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1775.0s	1775.0	 So if you're a CEO and they don't like you, you're going to resign, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1779.7s	1779.7	 If you're a company and they're worried about your propensity to be a little too frisky on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1785.1s	1785.1	 your own, they'll rein you in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1787.1s	1787.1	 They'll either use cybersecurity law or something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1789.1s	1789.1	 But the point is that I think that we shouldn't take this as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1792.7s	1792.7	 free market regulators having their way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1795.4s	1795.4	 This isn't Lena Khan implementing some laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1799.2s	1799.2	 This is a top down decision to nationalize large parts of the economy, starting with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1807.2s	1807.2	 technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1807.9s	1807.9	 And I know that for some people that may seem unfathomable, but if I'm a betting man,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1814.3s	1814.3	 which I am, that's what I would bet on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1816.7s	1816.7	 That this is the beginning of the beginning of an attempt to pull these companies in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1822.1s	1822.1	 I mean, what David said is true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1825.1s	1825.1	 The Chinese government owns the data of Chinese companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1828.4s	1828.4	 So at the end of the day, the Chinese government also owns the users and it also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1832.0s	1832.0	 owns the revenues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1832.9s	1832.9	 It just hasn't told you yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1834.4s	1834.4	 Yeah, in a way, it's like the Chinese government in our government is trying to officiate the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1839.3s	1839.3	 game fairly and create a really competitive, vibrant game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1844.7s	1844.7	 And I think what the Chinese government just said is the game's over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1847.6s	1847.6	 Like there is no game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1848.4s	1848.4	 Yeah, no, there's a game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1850.2s	1850.2	 It just has it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1851.1s	1851.1	 What is the game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1851.9s	1851.9	 One, because it hasn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1853.6s	1853.6	 It has a new procedure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1854.7s	1854.7	 It made a bunch of CEOs, general managers in a large corporation that report through a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1862.8s	1862.8	 But there's no more game in terms of building companies and investing in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1866.5s	1866.5	 How is the West ever going to trust?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1868.6s	1868.6	 How is Goldman Sachs or Sequoia, you know, launching a venture firm there or retail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1873.9s	1873.9	 investors or hedge fund investors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1875.5s	1875.5	 How are they ever going to want to participate in that market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1878.9s	1878.9	 So look, for example, when you invest in China, right, or if you set up a fund, you know, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1882.6s	1882.6	 are two pools of capital, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1884.1s	1884.1	 There's the local renminbi denominated investment vehicles, and then there's the U.S.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1888.3s	1888.3	 dollar denominated investment vehicles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1890.3s	1890.3	 And they do that to segregate where the capital comes from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1893.1s	1893.1	 So it's not too difficult for the Chinese government to basically say, you know what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1896.6s	1896.6	 I'm going to actually make a constraint on dollar inflows so that, you know, the renminbi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1903.1s	1903.1	 denominated investment funds that are from Chinese investors into Chinese companies needs to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1908.1s	1908.1	 above a certain percentage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1909.2s	1909.2	 Call it two thirds, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1910.6s	1910.6	 Or call it 80%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1911.6s	1911.6	 They can make all these decisions because these are all just rules that are completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1915.3s	1915.3	 under their control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1916.0s	1916.0	 So I think that people who don't think this is going to happen are probably not looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1921.0s	1921.0	 at the setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1921.7s	1921.7	 The setup seems to be directing itself towards that outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1924.7s	1924.7	 And by the way, it makes sense for what Xi Jinping wants to do from his perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1929.2s	1929.2	 But that's not my question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1930.2s	1930.2	 My question is, why would Masayoshi San or another entity ever invest in China?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1935.9s	1935.9	 Because you look through the risks and you got completely enamored by the population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1940.7s	1940.7	 in the Tam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1941.7s	1941.7	 But what I'm saying now is why would they do it again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1944.3s	1944.3	 Or are they not going to do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1945.5s	1945.5	 No, but there are there are boundary conditions that would say that even before this, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1949.1s	1949.1	 would have had to reconsider the population is shrinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1952.0s	1952.0	 There's a different demand side pull that's happening, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1954.8s	1954.8	 Older people need different kinds of services than younger people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1958.2s	1958.2	 There's not enough younger people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1959.8s	1959.8	 There's too many men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1960.7s	1960.7	 There's not enough women.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1961.7s	1961.7	 So there's not enough couples.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1962.8s	1962.8	 There's not all of these demographic issues ultimately will get reflected in the economic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1967.5s	1967.5	 reality, which is that smart investors would put money in China differently over time anyways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1974.1s	1974.1	 But I think that this is a bigger thing, as David said, which is if that's coming to pass,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1979.0s	1979.0	 you want to control the pipes because you want to control how that information is presented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1982.7s	1982.7	 to people, your citizens so that they don't get pissed off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1986.4s	1986.4	 And then you might as well just own the economy, own the business anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1989.1s	1989.1	 I see this as being amazing for American tech companies because I don't see who would ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1993.1s	1993.1	 want to be an entrepreneur, whoever has a great idea and wants to pursue it in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1997.6s	1997.6	 I just do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1998.8s	1998.8	 No, I disagree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=1999.7s	1999.7	 And the reason I disagree with you, we don't have access to their markets anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2003.0s	2003.0	 What company has access to their market?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2005.0s	2005.0	 The difference is young, smart Chinese people for decades have been staying in China in part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2010.5s	2010.5	 because it was more they could more relate culturally to Jack Ma than they could to Jack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2015.8s	2015.8	 Dorsey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2016.9s	2016.9	 Okay, that's just I mean, that just makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2018.9s	2018.9	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2019.4s	2019.4	 And I understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2020.3s	2020.3	 And then the second is we like a lot of like, sorry, like the opposite of some other Western
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2025.9s	2025.9	 countries that Canada closed our doors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2029.7s	2029.7	 Why would the next Jack Ma start a company if they saw Jack Ma disappear?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2034.7s	2034.7	 That's my question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2035.7s	2035.7	 Because you know what, if you're coming from China, and you can you can only make a billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2039.5s	2039.5	 versus 45 billion, I think you still take the shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2042.3s	2042.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2042.8s	2042.8	 I think J Cal is is right in the sense I don't think it's gonna be like a binary decision where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2047.2s	2047.2	 all of a sudden everyone just stops doing business in China, but they're going to be hedging their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2050.0s	2050.0	 bets. I mean, if you were a Chinese billionaire looking at this landscape, your your your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2055.2s	2055.2	 priority has got to be to get some wealth outside the country beyond the control of the CCP,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2059.9s	2059.9	 you're going to be buying Bitcoin, you're going to be trying to get your money overseas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2063.1s	2063.1	 You have got to be very nervous about what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2065.6s	2065.6	 buying homes in Palo Alto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2068.2s	2068.2	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2069.0s	2069.0	 I mean, look, I think what President Xi is doing is fundamentally redefining the bargain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2073.7s	2073.7	 between Chinese entrepreneurs and the government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2076.9s	2076.9	 And here here was the original bargain, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2078.7s	2078.7	 The great Chinese leader and economic reformer Deng Xiaoping basically set the bargain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2085.4s	2085.4	 40 years ago. And what basically the bargain was this, we're going to open up the economy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2089.8s	2089.8	 and let you the entrepreneur get rich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2092.3s	2092.3	 We're going to keep all the political power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2094.1s	2094.1	 So as long as you don't mess with us politically, you can get as rich as you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2097.9s	2097.9	 That was the original bargain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2099.7s	2099.7	 Now, President Xi is saying there's a new bargain, there's a new boss in town.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2104.5s	2104.5	 And here is the deal that economic interests in China will be subordinate to national interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2109.9s	2109.9	 Those national interests are defined by the CCP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2112.4s	2112.4	 And I run the CCP for life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2115.5s	2115.5	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2115.8s	2115.8	 And that is what is happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2117.1s	2117.1	 That is a big change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2118.7s	2118.7	 They just got layered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2120.6s	2120.6	 There is a new CEO that they report to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2122.5s	2122.5	 This actually makes me very hopeful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2124.7s	2124.7	 Actually, I think this is going to be like a spiraling down of their economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2129.4s	2129.4	 I don't think it's going to spiral up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2131.0s	2131.0	 I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2132.8s	2132.8	 Who's going to engage them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2133.9s	2133.9	 Who's going to invest in their economy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2135.5s	2135.5	 Everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2136.1s	2136.1	 Guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2136.6s	2136.6	 Because if you want a shred of fucking lithium, if you want a battery, if you want nickel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2141.2s	2141.2	 if you want anything to happen, you need to work with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2145.0s	2145.0	 They are incredibly smart and thoughtful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2147.1s	2147.1	 They had been strategic while we've been running around, complaining, crying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2153.2s	2153.2	 talking about the kindergarten soccer game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2156.3s	2156.3	 They were doing the hard work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2158.7s	2158.7	 They were doing it for decades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2160.3s	2160.3	 And until we find solutions that can work around them, we need to work with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2167.5s	2167.5	 I think they just throttled innovation and they just shot themselves in both feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2171.4s	2171.4	 I think they're going to regret this decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2173.3s	2173.3	 I would come out in the middle and say they've just attached a discount rate that now every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2177.5s	2177.5	 investor has to consider political risk when they invest in China because the future is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2182.8s	2182.8	 very uncertain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2184.0s	2184.0	 The bargain is getting changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2185.5s	2185.5	 And if you're an investor, you now have to take you're taking some huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2190.5s	2190.5	 I agree with David.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2191.5s	2191.5	 I think that's a better way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2192.3s	2192.3	 I would refine what I'm saying by saying it's a distribution of risk where it's closer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2196.4s	2196.4	 Russia now than it is to the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2198.5s	2198.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2198.7s	2198.7	 And then I think there's literally an act called the McGinsky Act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2205.5s	2205.5	 What is the act that Bill Broder's lawyer, McGinsky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2209.5s	2209.5	 Oh, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2211.0s	2211.0	 Because basically in Russia, they were just killing people and taking their businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2216.3s	2216.3	 I mean, this feels like the equivalent in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2218.8s	2218.8	 Magnitsky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2221.7s	2221.7	 I mean, they literally that was Bill Broder's lawyer who was tortured to death.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2227.1s	2227.1	 And I just don't see anybody wanting to invest or anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2230.5s	2230.5	 And it just does make the Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2232.9s	2232.9	 In hindsight, it does look like they shut down Bitcoin a couple of months before making these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2238.6s	2238.6	 actions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2239.4s	2239.4	 So your point, David, they probably anticipated that people would start shipping their money out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2243.9s	2243.9	 using Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2245.1s	2245.1	 And so they banned Bitcoin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2247.1s	2247.1	 And now they're banning CEOs from having too much power.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2250.2s	2250.2	 That was probably a sequential event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2252.1s	2252.1	 That would be very smart on their part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2254.0s	2254.0	 You know, can't leave smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2257.2s	2257.2	 What does this do to like the Sequoia capital China, the Masi Oshisan investing heavily there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2264.6s	2264.6	 Tencent investing here, all the Chinese very active in the United States investing in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2269.0s	2269.0	 companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2269.4s	2269.4	 All the Chinese LPs are fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2272.5s	2272.5	 All the Chinese GPs are fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2274.2s	2274.2	 All the Chinese companies are fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2275.5s	2275.5	 I think David's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2276.2s	2276.2	 It's just a discount factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2277.2s	2277.2	 I do think it affects global dollar flows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2279.9s	2279.9	 And I think it's hard for a Western capital pool to allocate money into China without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2288.1s	2288.1	 doing a little bit more work and applying a higher discount rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2291.1s	2291.1	 Yeah, I have to believe that the conversations happening in these firms that have made gobs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2297.5s	2297.5	 of money in China over the last couple of decades, it has to be are we living on borrowed time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2303.6s	2303.6	 How much more time do we have before China says that Chinese profits, Chinese return on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2309.3s	2309.3	 investment are going to go to Chinese individuals and companies under our control?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2314.1s	2314.1	 Because that's that's the direction it all seems to be headed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2316.7s	2316.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2317.1s	2317.1	 And how quickly can I get get out of these positions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2319.4s	2319.4	 I mean, how do you even get out of these positions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2321.8s	2321.8	 This is the other thing I don't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2322.8s	2322.8	 If they're going to reverse some IPOs, how does that mechanically happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2327.7s	2327.7	 Are they going to just say it's a buyout?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2329.4s	2329.4	 It's a second second transaction, and they'll just do like a buyout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2334.3s	2334.3	 So if Masi Oshisan owns some amount of DD, they say here's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2339.1s	2339.1	 the price per share that we pay you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2340.4s	2340.4	 Here's your cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2341.1s	2341.1	 Give us a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2341.9s	2341.9	 Ciao.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2343.5s	2343.5	 That's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2344.5s	2344.5	 A forced sale at whatever price they determine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2347.6s	2347.6	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2348.3s	2348.3	 I mean, like I think these things will operate more efficiently than that because you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2351.4s	2351.4	 a distributed shareholder base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2352.5s	2352.5	 So, you know, China can't force a shareholder of DD to sell the shares because it's listed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2357.4s	2357.4	 in an American stock exchange.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2358.7s	2358.7	 But they but if DD does go private, the way that you know, the news reports are saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2363.5s	2363.5	 somebody is going to have to backstop that capital, I suspect it will be a Chinese organization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2368.3s	2368.3	 So they will take DD private again, and then buy out all of the shareholders who bought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2374.4s	2374.4	 from around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2375.3s	2375.3	 If that does come to pass, I think that is the that is an obvious signal that we're moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2380.9s	2380.9	 into sort of a more nationalization of critical resources.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2385.9s	2385.9	 And China has determined that internet resources are critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2389.2s	2389.2	 And I think that that's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2390.3s	2390.3	 If I was in their shoes, that's exactly what I would do as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2392.7s	2392.7	 Does this mean that we should be kicking out Chinese companies from operating in the US,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2398.5s	2398.5	 i.e. TikTok, etc?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2400.9s	2400.9	 No, but I do think that TikTok needs to get carved out a bite dance that it needs to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2404.3s	2404.3	 a completely American cap table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2406.7s	2406.7	 But that shouldn't be a government edict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2408.6s	2408.6	 That should be something that the bite dance investors and board are scrambling to do right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2413.5s	2413.5	 now because otherwise, that equity value may go to zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2416.2s	2416.2	 ByteDance should be a half a trillion dollar company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2419.4s	2419.4	 It probably is a couple hundred billion dollar company now, which means that it probably lost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2424.7s	2424.7	 half of its market value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2426.0s	2426.0	 That's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2426.8s	2426.8	 Crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2427.6s	2427.6	 Yeah, I think I think there's a few things for us to worry about there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2430.7s	2430.7	 I mean, I like the idea about competing China by having freer and more open capital markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2438.4s	2438.4	 and allowing anyone in the world to invest in our companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2441.1s	2441.1	 I think the issues with TikTok are more around data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2444.7s	2444.7	 You know, we know now that any data that ByteDance has belongs to the Chinese government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2450.0s	2450.0	 This isn't just a TikTok issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2451.5s	2451.5	 It's any company, any US company that's doing business in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2456.4s	2456.4	 Look, it applies to Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2457.7s	2457.7	 OK, look, Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2459.2s	2459.2	 We're on Zoom right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2460.6s	2460.6	 Zoom is not a Chinese company, but it has a giant engineering team in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2466.5s	2466.5	 What are the data implications for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2468.0s	2468.0	 Yeah, they stopped routing their servers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2469.6s	2469.6	 Remember, they had some servers routing through China, but I do think they're going to have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2473.6s	2473.6	 shut down and sell off whatever their assets are in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2477.0s	2477.0	 That's going to be untenable to have a communication platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2480.1s	2480.1	 You know, it's kind of like Huawei, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2481.7s	2481.7	 We don't allow Huawei to operate and we're going to have to do that with software, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2485.8s	2485.8	 There's been a big CRISPR breakthrough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2488.3s	2488.3	 65 year old man named Patrick Daugherty was suffering with a disease in which his protein
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2495.1s	2495.1	 was misshaped, misshapen, building up in his body, destroying important tissues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2500.3s	2500.3	 such as nerves in his hands and feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2501.9s	2501.9	 He watched the same disease kill his dad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2504.5s	2504.5	 And here's the quote, had watched others get crippled and die,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2508.2s	2508.2	 difficult deaths from this disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2511.4s	2511.4	 And it's a terrible prognosis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2512.7s	2512.7	 He entered a trial utilizing CRISPR, the gene editing tool, and researchers reported the data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2518.7s	2518.7	 indicating that the experiment treatment worked well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2521.4s	2521.4	 The study Daugherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2526.4s	2526.4	 editor directly into patients and letting it find its own way to the right gene in the right cells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2530.7s	2530.7	 In this case, the cells in the liver making the destructive protein, the advance is being held,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2536.3s	2536.3	 not just as not just for amyloidosis patients, but also as a proof of concept that CRISPR could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2544.3s	2544.3	 be used to treat many other much more common diseases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2547.2s	2547.2	 It's a new way of using the innovative technology to my thoughts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2550.6s	2550.6	 I think this is a really important breakthrough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2552.5s	2552.5	 And what it allows us to do now is see a world where, look, if you think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2557.8s	2557.8	 the two different paths of the following idea, you're going to make a solution to a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2564.3s	2564.3	 If the problem was an internet company, or you wanted to make a product, what you would do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2570.0s	2570.0	 you would go to Amazon Web Services, you'd be able to consume a whole set of abstractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2574.9s	2574.9	 and then you would build a light amount of programming, which is essentially like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2578.6s	2578.6	 application logic of your app.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2580.3s	2580.3	 Right? I think a lot of people listening understand that idea because that's what they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2584.6s	2584.6	 Here, what we're getting to a place is now soon, we're going to be able to view biological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2589.2s	2589.2	 problems in the same way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2590.8s	2590.8	 So we're building all these small little building, I don't want to call them small,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2594.7s	2594.7	 but building these very important building blocks that is very much akin to the building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2599.2s	2599.2	 blocks we needed to put together the first set of computers, to put together MS-DOS,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2603.9s	2603.9	 all of that allowed us to create Windows, Windows allowed us to actually access the internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2609.1s	2609.1	 And there was this in seriatim development of things that happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2612.0s	2612.0	 And I think that we're on the verge of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2613.5s	2613.5	 And that's what these kinds of breakthroughs really show us, which is that you can view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2617.5s	2617.5	 So for example, in a different company, they've created these mRNA gate arrays, logic gate arrays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2623.5s	2623.5	 So if you're a chip designer, you would understand how to basically create electrical function,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2628.8s	2628.8	 in part using gate arrays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2631.2s	2631.2	 But if you reduce a biological function to the same idea, now that same person has a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2635.9s	2635.9	 translational ability to solve a different problem that they didn't have before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2639.8s	2639.8	 So I think what we're saying is that we're seeing this platformization, this AWSification
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2646.8s	2646.8	 of a biological tool chain, with things like CRISPR and all the other modalities that need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2651.6s	2651.6	 to stack on top of it so that the next person can view it as a programming problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2656.7s	2656.7	 And I think that that's the really exciting path that accelerates a lot of this development.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2661.9s	2661.9	 But this was an enormously important breakthrough because it validated a lot of what CRISPR was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2666.7s	2666.7	 beyond a lot of theoretical innovation that up until now was basically what it was known for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2673.1s	2673.1	 And a lot of investment had gone into companies that were trying to do things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2677.1s	2677.1	 But this was the first really important one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2680.6s	2680.6	 The funny thing about Intelli is that it's been public for like seven, eight years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2683.9s	2683.9	 and it's just been toiling, toiling, toiling, toiling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2686.3s	2686.3	 And then, you know, the last little while, obviously, it's gone absolutely crazy because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2689.7s	2689.7	 of this breakthrough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2691.2s	2691.2	 Yeah, and related news, CRISPR creates its first genetically modified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2695.7s	2695.7	 marsupials after years of using the gene editing technique,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2699.2s	2699.2	 CRISPR to genetically modify everything from vegetables to lab rodents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2703.1s	2703.1	 Researchers have used it to edit one of the hardest targets, that's marsupials,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2706.4s	2706.4	 the MIT technology reports.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2708.7s	2708.7	 I guess it turns out they're very hard to edit and we're now editing marsupials and changing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2713.5s	2713.5	 things like their hair color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2715.7s	2715.7	 So brave new world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2717.1s	2717.1	 Freeburg was here, the freeburg ratio will be off the charts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2720.3s	2720.3	 All right, wrapping up, we have pretty incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2722.3s	2722.3	 Just just one thing to add to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2723.9s	2723.9	 I mean, I think what it what it shows is that these COVID vaccines are just the first product,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2728.6s	2728.6	 the first breakthrough product of this mRNA technology, there's going to be a lot more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2733.8s	2733.8	 And what I wonder about is, you know, this this category of vaccine has some people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2737.9s	2737.9	 they're kind of like, you know, in the in the technology world, you have kind of a spectrum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2742.3s	2742.3	 of early adopters, late adopters, Luddites, you know, people are actively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2746.6s	2746.6	 against technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2748.4s	2748.4	 Well, I mean, Luddites are even laggards and that's yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2751.8s	2751.8	 Yeah, Luddites are even more violently opposed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2753.8s	2753.8	 I think the original Luddites, they I think the original Luddites were in England,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2758.3s	2758.3	 they lost their jobs in some factory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2759.9s	2759.9	 And so they've broken to the factory with sledgehammers to destroy all the machines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2763.2s	2763.2	 that replace their jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2764.3s	2764.3	 So there's clearly a spectrum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2766.3s	2766.3	 And what I wonder about is that if you're on sort of the Luddite end of the spectrum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2769.8s	2769.8	 with respect to biotechnology, I mean, are you going to have a materially worse life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2774.6s	2774.6	 because you're not getting the benefits of all these vaccines and all these treatments?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2779.2s	2779.2	 And I mean, COVID could just be the first example of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2782.1s	2782.1	 Well, I mean, if you build on it, it's sort of like we're going to create a two class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2785.1s	2785.1	 society, one that is not only dealing with all the maladies and cancers and living longer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2792.1s	2792.1	 but we haven't even started to think about well, taking somebody who's already in great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2796.1s	2796.1	 health, and what can you do for them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2798.1s	2798.1	 So oh, you know what, you can be two inches taller, you could add 10 IQ points, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2803.9s	2803.9	 run faster, you could have higher blood oxygen, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2806.6s	2806.6	 I mean, we could we could genetically modify people to stay underwater for 10 minutes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2811.5s	2811.5	 be, you know, better processors of oxygen like other mammals are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2816.3s	2816.3	 You could have super humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2817.5s	2817.5	 I mean, that's basically where this is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2820.7s	2820.7	 And that unlocks a whole nother level of ethical and moral considerations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2824.7s	2824.7	 But you're right, there could be a group of people who are like, I don't want to touch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2827.7s	2827.7	 any of this, and they die at 60, 70, 80 years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2830.7s	2830.7	 And then we got another class of people who embrace this, and they have 20 more IQ points.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2834.7s	2834.7	 Then they live to 120.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2836.6s	2836.6	 No, I mean, it sounds funny, but and like science fiction, but that is in the realm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2841.1s	2841.1	 of possibility in our lifetimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2842.9s	2842.9	 There's a lot of great science fiction written about this whole sort of transhumanist idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2847.7s	2847.7	 A book series I really like is Nexus by Ramis Nam, who actually was a developer at Microsoft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2855.4s	2855.4	 and you know, that became a writer and he writes with I'd say a high degree of sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2861.1s	2861.1	 accuracy, accuracy and specificity about these technologies and how they might evolve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2866.7s	2866.7	 There should be sure to check out that book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2868.7s	2868.7	 Jason, be honest, if you could actually increase anything in your body through this gene editing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2873.4s	2873.4	 what would it be?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2874.0s	2874.0	 Just throw anything out there with the first thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2876.3s	2876.3	 Put anything out there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2877.6s	2877.6	 Anything would increase my muscle mass 100% increase my muscle mass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2882.4s	2882.4	 But there's a percentage of fat would go down, not in reality and absolute terms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2887.6s	2887.6	 but just in percentages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2889.1s	2889.1	 So this CRISPR thing was a public company called Intelliotherapeutics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2893.7s	2893.7	 But I want to throw a shout out to another startup that seemingly I think may have had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2898.3s	2898.3	 a breakthrough this week called FormEnergy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2901.1s	2901.1	 And the reason why these guys are interesting is that they've built this incredibly massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2905.5s	2905.5	 long duration battery out of iron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2910.0s	2910.0	 Now, why is that important?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2912.7s	2912.7	 We have really simple ways of harvesting iron from the earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2917.8s	2917.8	 It is literally everywhere, everywhere you look iron exists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2921.2s	2921.2	 It's not so true for nickel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2922.7s	2922.7	 It's not true for cobalt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2923.9s	2923.9	 It's not true for manganese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2925.1s	2925.1	 It's not true for lithium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2926.7s	2926.7	 It's not true for all of these other specialty chemicals that we need in order to build batteries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2933.1s	2933.1	 But these guys have solved a very complicated technical challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2937.1s	2937.1	 that will allow you to store energy cheaply, which has huge implications for electricity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2941.5s	2941.5	 and grids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2943.5s	2943.5	 And so big shout out to these guys at FormEnergy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2946.1s	2946.1	 Because if it looks like what they said they did is true, it's a really important breakthrough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2953.4s	2953.4	 that will have some important ramifications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2956.8s	2956.8	 It's amazing, by the way, to see progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2960.2s	2960.2	 Now you wake up and you read these things and you're just like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2962.4s	2962.4	 God, this is incredible that there are people working away on shit that really matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2967.6s	2967.6	 It's almost as if there's like one group of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2970.3s	2970.3	 We talked about cynicism in a previous episode recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2973.6s	2973.6	 There's one group of people, whether you're in the founder circles or capital allocator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2978.2s	2978.2	 or a journalist covering the space, who understands it, there's a technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2985.9s	2985.9	 explosion going on here, an innovation that is going to solve a lot of problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2990.7s	2990.7	 And they have another group of people who think that all these problems are intractable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2993.9s	2993.9	 I'm kind of looking at this, you know, what happened with COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=2997.3s	2997.3	 And I was talking to my wife about global warming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3000.9s	3000.9	 Feels to me like we can solve global warming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3003.5s	3003.5	 Feels like it's very much in our control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3005.9s	3005.9	 And there's another group of people who feel like it's over and don't have kids because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3009.4s	3009.4	 the whole planet's going to go on fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3012.6s	3012.6	 I think Elon tweeted this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3014.8s	3014.8	 I think we've talked about this now with respect to China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3017.7s	3017.7	 But we have an enormous problem in the world in general, which is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3022.8s	3022.8	 unless our birth rate is positive and accretive, it has huge implications to progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3029.1s	3029.1	 If you just like, if you eliminate or you decrease the denominator of the global population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3035.1s	3035.1	 the odds that there's another Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos that are created are just lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3039.7s	3039.7	 And so net of anything else, a declining population rate, particularly in Western
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3045.1s	3045.1	 countries has huge detrimental effects to the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3048.1s	3048.1	 And so all the folks that think that they're going to solve the ecology of the world by not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3051.9s	3051.9	 having kids, it's a little misguided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3053.7s	3053.7	 The thing to do is to actually have a positive birth rate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3057.4s	3057.4	 find technological solutions to this problem, and allow what we've been able to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3061.6s	3061.6	 which is a rising populace to basically be motivated to work and solve problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3066.5s	3066.5	 And I think that we have to be very careful about that because if people don't get this right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3070.5s	3070.5	 they're going to take the wrong solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3072.5s	3072.5	 It's not going to be a solution at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3074.2s	3074.2	 And it's going to make the problems even worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3076.1s	3076.1	 Could you imagine if the population of the earth shrank in half, what it would mean in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3080.5s	3080.5	 terms of productivity, services, the health care requirements that are needed, the costs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3085.9s	3085.9	 of providing those things, the economic viability of countries will go away, it would be a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3091.0s	3091.0	 Yet there is a group of people who feel we should do exactly that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3094.7s	3094.7	 And not a small group of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3097.2s	3097.2	 Well, they think that I think the mistake is in thinking that human consumption is the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3105.8s	3105.8	 And specifically with respect to climate change or global warming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3109.3s	3109.3	 No, you can't see it that way because, look, humans in order to exist need to consume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3116.4s	3116.4	 and we're going to emit carbon as part of that process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3119.1s	3119.1	 The important thing to focus on is energy production.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3123.4s	3123.4	 Are you shifting to clean production?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3126.5s	3126.5	 Because you're never going to be able to shrink your consumption enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3129.5s	3129.5	 to basically eliminate carbon emissions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3132.4s	3132.4	 It has to be done on the production side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3134.6s	3134.6	 And one of the interesting things that's happening now, I think we should talk about, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3139.2s	3139.2	 in Europe, they're creating this new carbon trading plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3142.3s	3142.3	 I think China is even trying to set up one of these markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3145.1s	3145.1	 And so they're creating these new marketplaces to trade carbon permits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3151.7s	3151.7	 And I think the most exciting part about this is that it gives an incentive for innovators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3158.5s	3158.5	 to create new technologies that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3163.3s	3163.3	 They're called negative emissions technologies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3166.0s	3166.0	 Because what happens is if you have a technology to take carbon out of the atmosphere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3171.0s	3171.0	 you can now sell a permit on the exchange that gives somebody else the right to emit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3177.1s	3177.1	 that carbon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3178.3s	3178.3	 And now those technologies, those nets, the negative emission technologies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3183.4s	3183.4	 it's unclear whether they really exist yet, but no one's going to create them if there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3187.3s	3187.3	 not a customer for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3189.2s	3189.2	 And that's what's really cool about these new tradable permit schemes is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3192.9s	3192.9	 they create a buyer for those nets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3195.5s	3195.5	 And I think that's ultimately how we're going to solve this problem of climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3199.7s	3199.7	 We're not going to do it through reducing human consumption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3203.0s	3203.0	 Like we're going to have to go back to the Stone Age if you don't want to emit carbon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3206.5s	3206.5	 It's about moving to clean production of energy and creating negative emission technologies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3212.2s	3212.2	 Yeah, let me just build on that for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3214.6s	3214.6	 There's a bunch of cap and trade systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3216.3s	3216.3	 China basically has a carbon tax system in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3221.7s	3221.7	 The big thing that none of these folks have gotten to yet, but I think if you look at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3225.9s	3225.9	 laws in Europe, they're going there, is the idea of a carbon tariff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3229.9s	3229.9	 And I think these carbon taxes, if they actually exist properly, will look like a tariff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3234.7s	3234.7	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3236.4s	3236.4	 Let's just say you're Britain and you want to import a Volkswagen from Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3243.1s	3243.1	 If Britain has a carbon tariff that says basically you need to account for all of the emissions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3248.4s	3248.4	 that went into making this car, and I'm going to assess an import duty that basically maps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3255.5s	3255.5	 to that, I think that that's where the world is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3259.4s	3259.4	 And that's probably, David, to your point, it's going to be a really big value unlock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3263.6s	3263.6	 because the amount of money that will get both made but also destroyed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3268.0s	3268.0	 in that process will be incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3271.3s	3271.3	 And that's where we have a chance to really reimagine consumption in a different way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3275.5s	3275.5	 There are just so many categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3276.7s	3276.7	 I saw this interesting stat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3277.8s	3277.8	 If you look at CPG companies, companies like Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and you compare them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3283.1s	3283.1	 the places where they sell their goods like Walmart and Target, every single major big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3287.5s	3287.5	 box retailer has basically declared a net zero emission strategy in the next five to 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3292.5s	3292.5	 Not a single company on the CPG side has actually any plans to do anything meaningful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3298.6s	3298.6	 anywhere near 2030, 2045, 2050.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3302.0s	3302.0	 And when you look under the hood, those companies like P&G and Clorox are enormous emitters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3308.7s	3308.7	 enormous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3309.9s	3309.9	 So even though you walk into a Target and Amazon and you try to make yourself feel good thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3314.2s	3314.2	 to yourself, I'm buying something that's zero emissions, it's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3318.4s	3318.4	 It's basically that Amazon will bear the cost of getting to net zero, but the products that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3323.0s	3323.0	 you actually consume are horrible for the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3325.9s	3325.9	 And the amount of fossil fuels that went into it and the amount of plastic that will then get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3330.8s	3330.8	 put into the ocean, it's tremendous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3333.3s	3333.3	 And so moving slightly more aggressively beyond these cap and trade systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3338.5s	3338.5	 into something that looks more like a tariff, I think could be really important for the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3342.3s	3342.3	 And we're going to need to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3343.9s	3343.9	 There's and there are multiple ways to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3346.4s	3346.4	 I don't know if you guys saw Elon backed the X prize carbon sequestering, sequestering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3354.7s	3354.7	 project, which is $100 million prize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3357.2s	3357.2	 And you can do this in multiple ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3358.7s	3358.7	 You can do it at the factory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3359.9s	3359.9	 There's the one trillion trees.org.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3361.8s	3361.8	 I don't know if you saw that where they're trying to plant a trillion trees because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3364.7s	3364.7	 that's the original way to sequester this carbon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3367.9s	3367.9	 So there's going to be like three or four different ways to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3370.3s	3370.3	 And if there's an incentive to do it, yeah, that is going to help for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3375.8s	3375.8	 Part of why there's such political disagreement over this is because you look at approaches
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3381.4s	3381.4	 like the Green New Deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3383.6s	3383.6	 I mean, I think they understand the problem, but what they're proposing is always on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3389.3s	3389.3	 consumption side is basically politicians picking and choosing how people are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3393.8s	3393.8	 to consume carbon, whether it's cracking down on private planes to factories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3397.9s	3397.9	 I mean, again, taking us back to the Stone Age, nobody wants to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3403.2s	3403.2	 No one's saying I think wants to support that kind of totalitarian principle that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3409.1s	3409.1	 politicians get to tell us how to consume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3412.3s	3412.3	 But this is why I think these market based solutions where you say, look, carbon emissions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3418.9s	3418.9	 are obviously an externality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3420.5s	3420.5	 If you want to admit you need to basically pay the correct price for carbon emissions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3426.1s	3426.1	 And we use the money that you pay as some sort of whether it's a tax or whether it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3433.7s	3433.7	 buying a permit, we use that money then offset into negative carbon emissions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3437.1s	3437.1	 It's a market based system where the government controls the externality, but they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3441.6s	3441.6	 dictate how people get to consume carbon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3444.0s	3444.0	 And I think that's the right balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3446.2s	3446.2	 We don't really have that type of balanced conversation in the US yet, because you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3451.8s	3451.8	 kind of got one side that says they want to save the planet, but they want to control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3456.2s	3456.2	 everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3456.7s	3456.7	 And then you got the other side saying, well, look, I want to save the economy because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3460.1s	3460.1	 your plan, the Green New Deal is going to destroy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3462.3s	3462.3	 What we need is, is again, a market based solution to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3466.1s	3466.1	 And I guess the criticism of a market based solution is you're basically giving people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3471.4s	3471.4	 a way to the most cynical interpretation would be you can pay to pollute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3476.7s	3476.7	 You can just you can pollute all you want and just pay a fine essentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3480.7s	3480.7	 But that's not the right way to look at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3482.3s	3482.3	 You're actually offsetting somebody else's capturing what you put out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3486.0s	3486.0	 And depending on the rules of the road, if you had to capture 50% more than you put in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3490.6s	3490.6	 you could create a formula there, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3492.8s	3492.8	 I mean, there could be some formula that over time, there's been a lot of fraud in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3497.4s	3497.4	 market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3497.8s	3497.8	 Like, you know, people sell these carbon credits from, you know, certain forests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3503.5s	3503.5	 And there's this joke, which is like there's been a tree that's been sold like 80 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3507.7s	3507.7	 times because it's like, you can't really verify you can only really estimate the amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3512.4s	3512.4	 of carbon sequestration that, you know, for example, a tree actually does in the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3516.3s	3516.3	 place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3516.8s	3516.8	 And so there's been just a lot of unfortunately, you know, fly by night, unreliable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3523.7s	3523.7	 non trustworthy ways that this market has evolved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3526.9s	3526.9	 People have been waiting for decades for this carbon trading market to really step into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3530.3s	3530.3	 high gear, which is why some folks think the more aggressive plan will just be introduced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3534.1s	3534.1	 tariffs and let the market to David to your point sorted out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3537.4s	3537.4	 Jamoth, what do you think the prospects are for these negative emission technology?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3540.8s	3540.8	 I can't believe that a solution as low tech as planting trees is going to solve the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3546.7s	3546.7	 And algae.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3547.9s	3547.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3548.5s	3548.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3548.7s	3548.7	 So the question is, what do you think, assuming we create the market, the demand for negative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3555.2s	3555.2	 emission technologies, the permits to emit, what do you think the prospects are technologically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3561.8s	3561.8	 that innovators are going to come up with these solutions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3564.3s	3564.3	 I do think that we are a couple of breakthroughs away from these things being non issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3569.1s	3569.1	 So I'll give you a couple of examples.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3570.9s	3570.9	 If you look at like, I'll just use batteries as an example, because we're I'm spending a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3573.9s	3573.9	 lot of time when you look back and like you ask yourself, like, how did we decide to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3579.3s	3579.3	 the batteries the way we make them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3581.5s	3581.5	 Um, you know, was it some like, you know, broad survey of every single chemical composition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3587.4s	3587.4	 and all these different structures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3588.7s	3588.7	 And we realized that, you know, a composition of nickel and manganese and cobalt was the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3593.9s	3593.9	 right thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3595.7s	3595.7	 Or lithium and iron and phosphate was it turned out that it was mostly like a handful of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3600.4s	3600.4	 decided, and we all just been iterating around the edges ever since.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3604.1s	3604.1	 So one of the solutions to a lot of these problems is to actually go back to first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3608.0s	3608.0	 principles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3609.0s	3609.0	 The problem is that as these industries get built up, and you know this, you have so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3615.9s	3615.9	 PP&E, like so much equipment, so much investment in physical capex that's happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3621.5s	3621.5	 The idea of switching platforms is almost impossible because it's not economically viable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3626.4s	3626.4	 So we are in this situation today where a bunch of solutions have been proposed David to solve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3632.1s	3632.1	 that problem, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3633.5s	3633.5	 The problem with carbon capture and other other things and negative emission technologies is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3637.4s	3637.4	 that they're extremely expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3638.8s	3638.8	 They're very inefficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3640.1s	3640.1	 They require an enormous amount of energy themselves, and it's not clear that they work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3645.9s	3645.9	 So what's happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3647.3s	3647.3	 One is that there's been some pretty novel innovations in moving people past some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3651.8s	3651.8	 these basic problems by looking at the periodic table to try to find different ways of solving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3656.5s	3656.5	 things like energy storage, which has huge implications to climate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3660.2s	3660.2	 But the second is that we are pushing the boundaries of physics in different ways as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3664.5s	3664.5	 well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3664.8s	3664.8	 And that's where there's going to be the potential for an enormous breakthrough, specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3669.1s	3669.1	 around superconductors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3670.4s	3670.4	 So what is a superconductor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3672.4s	3672.4	 It's something that allows an enormous amount of energy to basically trans through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3678.2s	3678.2	 Now we have this issue, which is that you can actually create superconductors in highly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3682.7s	3682.7	 controlled environments that are extremely, extremely cold, but they have incredible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3686.7s	3686.7	 performance characteristics that would revolutionize power and energy transmission and storage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3691.1s	3691.1	 People have been innovating in bringing that up to room temperature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3695.8s	3695.8	 In that breakthrough, which I think you will see in the next 20 to 30 years, it's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3700.8s	3700.8	 a complete sea change of how we think about this whole problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3703.3s	3703.3	 So I think the short term, we're innovating in the periodic table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3707.3s	3707.3	 In the long term, we're figuring out how to bend the laws of physics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3711.7s	3711.7	 And I think that those are probably the two most practical solutions to a lot of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3716.5s	3716.5	 things that remove the constraints that we've created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3721.3s	3721.3	 And again, the constraints have been completely human defined, which is the sad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3725.1s	3725.1	 They were not necessary from the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3726.9s	3726.9	 We could have made very different decisions had we known these problems were going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3730.3s	3730.3	 be as big as they were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3731.2s	3731.2	 You know, the way that we make plastic didn't have to be this way, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3734.7s	3734.7	 The amount of petroleum that we use, it didn't have to be in this specific way, but this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3739.1s	3739.1	 is where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3739.9s	3739.9	 And there are direct air capture technologies, DAC, which is basically an energy issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3745.0s	3745.0	 You can literally suck the carbon dioxide out of the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3749.5s	3749.5	 And again, another issue of material science, because the substrates that you use tend to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3754.6s	3754.6	 be relatively inefficient and sort of really activate them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3757.1s	3757.1	 You're pumping a tremendous amount of energy through there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3759.3s	3759.3	 That's the issue is, can you get the energy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3761.1s	3761.1	 And I think when we talked about the small reactors, the small modular nuclear reactors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3767.3s	3767.3	 if energy is free, or it's solar based, you could kind of get a virtual cycle going here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3773.1s	3773.1	 That's essentially what superconductors allows you to see is a world where you basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3776.3s	3776.3	 have limitless free energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3779.1s	3779.1	 It sounds like the thing that we all agree on is that this problem is ultimately going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3781.9s	3781.9	 to be solved by innovation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3783.3s	3783.3	 And this is the problem I have with so many of the political proposals is, you know, our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3788.3s	3788.3	 ability to innovate is a function of the size and scope of our economy and the incentives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3792.8s	3792.8	 and rewards for innovation and the freedom for entrepreneurs to do their thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3797.1s	3797.1	 And if you crush that, you know, with government mandates, you won't get the innovation we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3801.9s	3801.9	 need to get out of this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3802.9s	3802.9	 We can easily innovate our way out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3805.9s	3805.9	 And it requires some individual to say, I want to dedicate my life to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3810.5s	3810.5	 And then what is the motivation to do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3813.4s	3813.4	 And who are the capital allocators who are going to give them the billion dollars to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3817.2s	3817.2	 create this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3819.3s	3819.3	 I spent a bunch of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3820.3s	3820.3	 So I'm the capital allocator that will give billions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3822.3s	3822.3	 In fact, I did a survey of the superconductor space as an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3826.1s	3826.1	 And here's what I found of the of the four folks that I found who are all each individually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3833.6s	3833.6	 doing things in superconductors that I think are incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3836.7s	3836.7	 They're all immigrants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3838.9s	3838.9	 Every single one were not born in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3842.5s	3842.5	 You could you they are so fucking happy to be here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3849.1s	3849.1	 They feel so lucky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3850.9s	3850.9	 And they don't understand why everybody complains all the fucking time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3855.5s	3855.5	 Yeah, complaining is there is a disease of constantly complaining about stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3861.8s	3861.8	 And if you count the number of times you complain every day, and it's more than two or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3866.3s	3866.3	 times a day, you need to get your head examined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3869.4s	3869.4	 You're probably just talking yourself into anxiety problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3872.7s	3872.7	 Stop complaining, start building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3874.2s	3874.2	 I mean, these problems are solvable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3875.7s	3875.7	 There is an immigrant in in the United States right now that will figure out how to conduct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3880.7s	3880.7	 electricity without resistance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3882.3s	3882.3	 It will transform the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3884.0s	3884.0	 And we are so fucking lucky that that guy came here to this country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3887.9s	3887.9	 And we have the chance to give the guy billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3889.9s	3889.9	 One of my favorite movies is Wag the Dog with a great movie and Robert De Niro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3895.9s	3895.9	 And Dustin Hoffman plays this producer character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3899.1s	3899.1	 And every time there's a setback, he's like, Oh, this is nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3903.2s	3903.2	 I remember we made this movie and three out of the four lead actors died.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3906.5s	3906.5	 And we recast the movie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3907.9s	3907.9	 It's like, this is nothing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3909.9s	3909.9	 And, you know, that's sort of his catchphrase is he's got this can do attitude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3913.9s	3913.9	 No matter what setback happens, he just makes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3916.3s	3916.3	 It's like, Oh, this is nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3917.6s	3917.6	 We got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3918.1s	3918.1	 And, you know, and that's kind of the attitude you need if you want to be an entrepreneur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3922.4s	3922.4	 is there's gonna be so many setbacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3924.5s	3924.5	 You got to be like, Oh, this is nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3925.9s	3925.9	 And you figure out a way around it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3927.1s	3927.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3927.5s	3927.5	 This one of the guys that are working on superconductors showed me his data for the last 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3932.4s	3932.4	 And what's interesting, David, to your point is he had a four year period where he took a huge step back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3936.7s	3936.7	 Where basically like, you know, he had this superconductor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3939.5s	3939.5	 He's like, it works at, you know, I'm just going to use simple numbers here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3943.5s	3943.5	 But like, you know, minus 300 Celsius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3946.5s	3946.5	 He got it all the way up to minus, you know, 100.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3949.3s	3949.3	 And then it went back to minus 200.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3952.2s	3952.2	 For four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3954.2s	3954.2	 Could you imagine the mental devastation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3956.9s	3956.9	 And I said, how did you deal with it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3958.3s	3958.3	 He goes, ah, you know, basically, he's like, ah, it's nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3961.8s	3961.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3962.3s	3962.3	 And thank God for that guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3963.9s	3963.9	 It's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3964.4s	3964.4	 I just listened to Quentin Tarantino's on a podcasting tour because he's got a new book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3969.5s	3969.5	 He wrote a novel out of the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood characters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3973.9s	3973.9	 And I just started listening to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3975.0s	3975.0	 It's fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3976.4s	3976.4	 Listen on Audible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3979.0s	3979.0	 And Brian Coppleman, from the moment interviewed Quentin, I listened to it yesterday on my bike ride.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3986.9s	3986.9	 And he was just talking about how he just never gave up and he had written True Romance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3991.7s	3991.7	 And then he wrote, what was the other one he wrote at that time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3995.8s	3995.8	 Natural Born Killers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3996.7s	3996.7	 Natural Born Killers, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=3997.9s	3997.9	 And he was just talking about how the first movie nobody would do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4001.5s	4001.5	 Then he wrote the two screenplays and nobody would do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4004.1s	4004.1	 And then he got to Reservoir Dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4005.8s	4005.8	 And, you know, they tried to scrape together $800,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4009.8s	4009.8	 And he kept asking me, why didn't you quit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4012.7s	4012.7	 Why didn't you quit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4013.1s	4013.1	 He's like, well, you know, I just figured it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4015.5s	4015.5	 Like, I figured out I had a voice and then nobody would buy my scripts because I was trying to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4019.9s	4019.9	 something innovative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4021.4s	4021.4	 And they were reading the scripts and they didn't understand what I was doing in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4025.1s	4025.1	 of innovating on how a movie would be with, you know, how he does with Pulp Fiction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4028.9s	4028.9	 He changes the time and tells the storytelling in a nonlinear fashion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4032.7s	4032.7	 They think nobody understood it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4034.3s	4034.3	 But every time I read it, I realized I had a voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4036.7s	4036.7	 It was my voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4037.5s	4037.5	 It was getting better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4039.2s	4039.2	 And then people, you know, I sold those movies and then he kept building them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4043.1s	4043.1	 And it was very inspiring to think about that take of like, he just didn't give up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4048.1s	4048.1	 And he just totally looked at work and he found his he found his own value in his own work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4054.7s	4054.7	 Improving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4056.3s	4056.3	 Even without the external, you know, it's a it's a fantastic story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4060.5s	4060.5	 It's like one of those classic, you know, Hollywood or entrepreneur stories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4063.5s	4063.5	 He's working at a video store for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4066.1s	4066.1	 And, you know, he would start record.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4068.2s	4068.2	 He was making his own movie and he would film on the weekends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4072.6s	4072.6	 And then, you know, he made a few hundred dollars every week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4075.5s	4075.5	 And then he would rent the equipment on a Friday because then they would only charge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4079.1s	4079.1	 him for one day because it was the weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4080.8s	4080.8	 So you could basically record the entire weekend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4083.2s	4083.2	 And so he'd go off and record and and then he'd have to go back to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4087.6s	4087.6	 And he started making this movie, you know, one weekend at a time for like two or three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4091.9s	4091.9	 And then he finally put you didn't even have the money to get the film developed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4095.1s	4095.1	 So finally, after three years, he gets the film developed and he's like, unfortunately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4098.4s	4098.4	 it sucked. It wasn't what he was expecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4100.6s	4100.6	 But during that time, he wrote True Man's, which then got bought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4104.7s	4104.7	 He sold that screenplay that gave him a little bit of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4108.0s	4108.0	 Then he wrote Resor Dogs and then he met Lawrence Bender.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4111.5s	4111.5	 And, you know, Bender went out, read the script and was like, holy shit, this is amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4115.2s	4115.2	 They raised a million or so bucks to make the movie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4118.1s	4118.1	 And then that kind of launched everything.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4392.3s	4392.3	 You should do the tasting manual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4393.6s	4393.6	 It's like, oh, you're tasting money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4394.6s	4394.6	 Fuck it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4394.8s	4394.8	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4395.6s	4395.6	 I'll put more truffles on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4396.8s	4396.8	 It's not truffle season.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4397.7s	4397.7	 Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4397.9s	4397.9	 He's like, OK, we'll make it truffle season.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4399.3s	4399.3	 Anyway, you start bringing the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4402.1s	4402.1	 And he wants to eat a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4404.7s	4404.7	 And they bring him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4406.3s	4406.3	 I can't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4406.8s	4406.8	 One of those funny scenes in a movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4408.3s	4408.3	 where they pulled the tin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4410.0s	4410.0	 And it's like a small piece of meat that's like a giant plate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4414.5s	4414.5	 Giant Schaefer comes flying off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4417.7s	4417.7	 A piece of parsley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4419.1s	4419.1	 And that's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4420.2s	4420.2	 The steak was the size of a pack of Wrigley's gum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4423.9s	4423.9	 I am not kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4425.3s	4425.3	 They took a beautiful steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4427.1s	4427.1	 And they just made a little rectangle out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4431.0s	4431.0	 He takes his fork.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4432.8s	4432.8	 He puts it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4433.5s	4433.5	 And he holds it up to the woman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4434.5s	4434.5	 He goes, where's my steak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4436.4s	4436.4	 And he puts the whole steak in his mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4438.0s	4438.0	 He's swallowing it in one bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4439.8s	4439.8	 She goes, sir, that was your steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4441.2s	4441.2	 He's like, I want a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4443.4s	4443.4	 I'm hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4444.5s	4444.5	 I want a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4445.5s	4445.5	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4445.9s	4445.9	 A steak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4447.3s	4447.3	 The whole restaurant's turned on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4448.5s	4448.5	 He's like, I ordered a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4449.9s	4449.9	 This is not a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4451.1s	4451.1	 If you ask him about this trip, he's like, I lost so much money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4455.1s	4455.1	 I didn't eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4456.3s	4456.3	 It was cold in Boston.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4457.7s	4457.7	 It was cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4458.3s	4458.3	 It was the worst trip ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4459.3s	4459.3	 It was a horrible trip ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4460.5s	4460.5	 And he is like, the woman's like, well, how can we make you happy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4463.9s	4463.9	 He's like, bring me a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4466.5s	4466.5	 Well, sir, we gave you a steak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4467.9s	4467.9	 The steak came.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4469.1s	4469.1	 How many steaks are you going to afford now that Robin Hood just won public?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4472.8s	4472.8	 Congrats, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4475.1s	4475.1	 Yeah, you know, right now it's my third biggest win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4478.3s	4478.3	 Uber, Comm, and then this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4480.4s	4480.4	 And, you know, time and market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4482.4s	4482.4	 I think Robin Hood going out of 30 billion, there's a chance this could go 10, 20, 30x from here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4489.1s	4489.1	 I think it could be a trillion dollar company someday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4491.5s	4491.5	 22 million members, even through all the craziness that we talked about on this podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4496.5s	4496.5	 You know, they're learning, they're fixing things, and 22 million people using the product,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4501.5s	4501.5	 and they're going to launch so many other products as part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4504.2s	4504.2	 And all these young people getting financially illiterate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4506.3s	4506.3	 I know it's a double edged sword, but I kind of feel like this generation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4510.3s	4510.3	 Balance, it's it's better balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4512.6s	4512.6	 It's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4513.3s	4513.3	 I mean, can you imagine if we were in our 20s trading derivatives and options and just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4518.1s	4518.1	 trading stocks all day?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4519.1s	4519.1	 I wanted to do that, but it was too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4520.9s	4520.9	 You had to get a broker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4522.2s	4522.2	 It was $35 a trade when I started trading and you had to call Charles Schwab and put it in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4528.5s	4528.5	 Of all the things of all the things I could have done online in my 20s and 30s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4533.0s	4533.0	 trading stocks didn't end up being high on the list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4535.4s	4535.4	 But you can play a lot of cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4537.6s	4537.6	 I mean, a lot of cards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4539.3s	4539.3	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4539.5s	4539.5	 But that's what these kids are doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4540.9s	4540.9	 Like for them, this is, you know, in the same zone, a lot of them as sports betting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4545.5s	4545.5	 wagering, playing poker for money, they're learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4549.1s	4549.1	 I don't know how you feel about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4550.2s	4550.2	 It's a great investment strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4552.7s	4552.7	 Well, I mean, if you make a lot of mistakes early in your career, when you're making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4556.1s	4556.1	 $100 bets or buying a tenth of a stock, you know, small stakes, and you're going to learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4560.8s	4560.8	 a hell of a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4561.6s	4561.6	 So I think the education part is you can only learn by doing right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4565.3s	4565.3	 So I mean, you can't learn in a.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4568.1s	4568.1	 And then, okay, listen, there's been an amazing episode, even with our freeburg.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4573.9s	4573.9	 Let the conspiracy theories abound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4577.2s	4577.2	 But freeburg just was busy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4578.6s	4578.6	 He couldn't make it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4579.2s	4579.2	 And we all wanted to we missed each other.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4615.5s	4615.5	 Take it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4615.9s	4615.9	 It's your driveway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4616.7s	4616.7	 So.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4622.4s	4622.4	 We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4626.3s	4626.3	 It's like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwloQFAwhPk&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=93&t=4630.4s	4630.4	 What.
