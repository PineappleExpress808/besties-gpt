https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=120.3s	120.3	 What was your peak weight in the last 12 months?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=123.8s	123.8	 I think I was at in the high one 90s and I'm down to about 172 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=129.0s	129.0	 So it's about 25 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=131.4s	131.4	 Wow. Since since about April or May.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=138.2s	138.2	 I think as a friend, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=139.5s	139.5	 No, but seriously, it can't get out longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=141.3s	141.3	 Really fucking great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=142.9s	142.9	 I'm really I'm really proud of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=144.3s	144.3	 Exercising, too. Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=145.9s	145.9	 Or you just cut your diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=146.8s	146.8	 It's it's I'm doing the same exercise regimen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=149.8s	149.8	 I was doing before, which is just running occasionally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=151.6s	151.6	 But it's all diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=154.5s	154.5	 It's all diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=155.6s	155.6	 It's frankly, severe calorie restriction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=158.5s	158.5	 And your your Munich product has been very helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=161.2s	161.2	 But is it really severe calorie restriction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=163.4s	163.4	 Thanks for the plug. I think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=164.8s	164.8	 Yeah, we were talking about Munich for the syndicate on the call in app.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=168.3s	168.3	 The other day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=170.3s	170.3	 The fucking plugs are dropping from the sky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=172.8s	172.8	 Well, hold on. I'm allowed to plug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=174.6s	174.6	 I'm allowed to plug another bestie product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=177.2s	177.2	 So you could put a call in plug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=178.7s	178.7	 You know, you're violating our rules of the road that we wrote down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=181.8s	181.8	 It's not a violation of the rules because I'm not a shareholder in Munich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=184.9s	184.9	 I don't know any interest in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=186.3s	186.3	 But are you negotiating a deal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=187.7s	187.7	 No. But now I'm outfunding Munich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=190.5s	190.5	 No, I haven't. But Freebrook, can I invest?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=195.9s	195.9	 That's a good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=196.8s	196.8	 We should actually throw that one in the syndicate if you guys want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=200.1s	200.1	 Yeah, Munich's great. I did it. I lost some weight on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=202.3s	202.3	 Saxipoo, what's your what's your basal calorie burn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=206.5s	206.5	 Did you calculate that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=207.7s	207.7	 What does that mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=208.4s	208.4	 Like your steady state calorie burn on a normal day?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=211.0s	211.0	 Like if you're not exercising or whatever, like, yeah, based on your height,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=213.9s	213.9	 your BMI, your weight, all that stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=215.4s	215.4	 Yeah, I did. I did look it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=217.1s	217.1	 And I think it's around 2000 calories a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=219.6s	219.6	 But the thing that's super interesting, yeah, there's a calculator online
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=222.4s	222.4	 where you can enter your your height, weight and age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=226.2s	226.2	 And it'll tell you how many calories that you burn every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=228.9s	228.9	 So if you want to lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=231.8s	231.8	 It's that simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=232.8s	232.8	 Everything else that people do around weight loss that is not that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=236.5s	236.5	 is basically some sort of game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=238.3s	238.3	 You just have to consume fewer calories than you're burning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=241.0s	241.0	 But the thing that's really interesting about that calculator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=243.0s	243.0	 is that the number of calories you can burn every year actually changes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=246.3s	246.3	 as you get older, it goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=248.1s	248.1	 So the reason why people gain weight as they get older
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=250.9s	250.9	 is because you're in a habit of consuming a certain number of calories every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=254.3s	254.3	 But, you know, as you get older, like every year,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=256.6s	256.6	 you can consume, say, 50 fewer calories a day, something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=260.0s	260.0	 And that basically becomes fat if you if you consume at the same level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=263.8s	263.8	 So you have to cut your consumption down as you get older or you will gain weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=267.9s	267.9	 And in addition to your metabolic fitness, meaning like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=271.3s	271.3	 having your exercise level stay up to increase your metabolism overall,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=275.0s	275.0	 you can also add muscle mass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=276.5s	276.5	 A lot of people lose muscle mass over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=278.5s	278.5	 Yep. Muscle burns more calories per day just to kind of keep functioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=284.1s	284.1	 So the more muscle mass you have, the higher your basal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=287.3s	287.3	 You lose like half a pound to a pound a year after 40.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=290.6s	290.6	 Is that correct? Directionally free birth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=293.2s	293.2	 I don't know, but that sounds about right. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=294.9s	294.9	 Yeah, that's what I read. That is about right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=296.9s	296.9	 And I think it's because this dynamic where people are just consuming the same amount,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=300.6s	300.6	 but they don't realize that they can't burn it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=303.1s	303.1	 And so it becomes fat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=306.0s	306.0	 You know, so to my case, first of all, you got to get your caloric intake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=309.3s	309.3	 down to 2000 just to get to steady state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=312.4s	312.4	 And that can be a challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=313.9s	313.9	 But if you really want to lose weight, you need to burn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=317.0s	317.0	 You need to basically consume a few hundred calories less than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=320.1s	320.1	 And if you can consume 500 calories less than that per day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=322.7s	322.7	 that's considered rapid weight loss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=325.2s	325.2	 And then you can actually see the results, which is very motivating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=328.2s	328.2	 Yeah. So I like the idea of just going for the like significant, the 500 calories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=332.5s	332.5	 Where are you? You're at 1500 calories a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=335.1s	335.1	 Yeah, I mean, I think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=336.5s	336.5	 I mean, I haven't like precisely measured it out, but I've been trying to go for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=339.9s	339.9	 And is that you skip a meal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=341.3s	341.3	 Is that how you get to the minus 500 calories?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=343.6s	343.6	 Yeah, I will either skip breakfast or I'll do a very light breakfast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=347.0s	347.0	 And then for lunch, I'll do like something entirely plant based,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=351.1s	351.1	 like like soup, like a vegetable soup of some kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=354.6s	354.6	 And then when it comes to dinner, it'll be a more normal dinner, but no carbs, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=358.3s	358.3	 Two dinners, one bottle of wine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=360.7s	360.7	 Well, no, no, you have a good system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=362.3s	362.3	 The SAC system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=363.7s	363.7	 Yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=364.5s	364.5	 The SAC system is vegetables first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=366.4s	366.4	 Yes. Then fish, then poultry, then red meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=370.2s	370.2	 So it's it's not you're not like entirely all one thing or another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=375.2s	375.2	 You're not like all vegan, which would be hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=377.3s	377.3	 You're not. It's not like you're all there's no red meat or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=381.9s	381.9	 You can do a little of everything, but you have to have a weighting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=384.3s	384.3	 And the weighting is based on what foods have are the most calorie dense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=388.2s	388.2	 So the mistake that I think people make, and I think it's one of these trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=391.2s	391.2	 diets is like with these protein, like the South Beach type diet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=395.0s	395.0	 or the paleo diet, right, where they're trying to trick their body into ketosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=399.3s	399.3	 and all they do is eat a lot of red meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=401.2s	401.2	 But those steaks have a lot of calories in them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=403.7s	403.7	 So it only works if you do it perfectly, where you totally trick your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=407.5s	407.5	 and keeping your body in ketosis forever is not sustainable, in my view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=411.2s	411.2	 It's hard. So I think you're a lot better off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=413.6s	413.6	 just eating less calorie dense food and steak is very calorie dense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=417.6s	417.6	 So, you know, again, you try to be king of space than fish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=421.8s	421.8	 I rarely eat beef, but I get to eat it today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=425.5s	425.5	 And I'm having steak night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=427.1s	427.1	 Drey's coming over for dinner and in the season, he whenever I text him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=431.1s	431.1	 and I say, hey, what do you want for dinner?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=433.1s	433.1	 Draymond's always like fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=435.0s	435.0	 And I said, bro, I I get to eat steak so fucking rarely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=439.5s	439.5	 And today we're having steak. I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=442.1s	442.1	 My mouth is watering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=443.3s	443.3	 When you get to it's because you're on some diet, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=445.7s	445.7	 No, no, I do. I just observe that I don't eat meat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=449.8s	449.8	 any more than once a week maximum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=451.9s	451.9	 And right now, I'm probably averaging once every two weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=454.9s	454.9	 maybe even once every three weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=456.2s	456.2	 And to your point, it's much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=457.8s	457.8	 I do these scans, you know, you can do these kind of body scans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=462.0s	462.0	 to know what your your total water weight, your total muscle weight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=465.9s	465.9	 your total weight, your total body fat, all of that stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=468.9s	468.9	 and your base metabolic rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=470.4s	470.4	 And I just kind of track it like once a quarter just to see where it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=474.4s	474.4	 And I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=475.7s	475.7	 Like, I've really found that I can't eat red meat anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=478.7s	478.7	 Like, it's like it just really fucks me up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=481.1s	481.1	 But it's so good. It's so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=482.9s	482.9	 Oh, my God. It's so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=484.2s	484.2	 The other one other trick is that you should never consume calories
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=488.8s	488.8	 like in liquid form, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=490.1s	490.1	 You should only be drinking water, tea, coffee, things like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=494.2s	494.2	 that don't have any calories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=495.6s	495.6	 People go to Starbucks in the morning and they drink like four.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=499.0s	499.0	 Yeah. Four hundred plus calories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=500.5s	500.5	 Then they have a, you know, cinnamon roll or whatever or banana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=504.6s	504.6	 Yeah, they're at twelve hundred at the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=506.1s	506.1	 Yeah. I mean, that's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=507.6s	507.6	 I mean, you're going to be gaining weight on just from going to Starbucks in the morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=510.2s	510.2	 There's no now if you do an Americano with a splash of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=514.2s	514.2	 almond milk or something, that's like five, ten calories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=516.0s	516.0	 That's fine. But you have to stop drinking calories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=519.4s	519.4	 And then the one exception is like last night we did poker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=522.8s	522.8	 We were drinking wine. So that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=525.4s	525.4	 You know, I know because I thought the wine was shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=528.4s	528.4	 Yeah, let's talk about the whole game was horrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=532.0s	532.0	 Let me just tell you all the things that were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=533.5s	533.5	 Oh, here we go. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=535.3s	535.3	 Number one, I fucking came all the way up to San Francisco last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=537.9s	537.9	 Chamath normally hosts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=539.1s	539.1	 Sax went over the top number one is over the top in air quotes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=543.7s	543.7	 Number one, nobody arrived on time because nobody respects you enough to show up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=549.4s	549.4	 J.K. and I played heads up for an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=551.9s	551.9	 Our anyone else showed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=553.1s	553.1	 We were there from seven ages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=554.5s	554.5	 Like it was fun. It was fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=556.1s	556.1	 I took all the free bugs money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=557.9s	557.9	 I own three percent of Munich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=560.0s	560.0	 You as the host didn't show up till nine thirty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=563.5s	563.5	 and you spent all of the time on the phone trading outside in the room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=567.6s	567.6	 trading Japanese bonds or doing whatever you were doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=570.2s	570.2	 Talking to Peter to showed up at ten thirty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=573.5s	573.5	 You know, the game was basically randomly in the mock half the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=577.2s	577.2	 Nobody was observing any good decorum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=579.2s	579.2	 Run it once, run it twice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=580.5s	580.5	 There was just nothing going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=582.0s	582.0	 You had to stay fish. You had stale fish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=584.8s	584.8	 OK, just sitting there rotting, stinking up the whole fucking room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=588.4s	588.4	 You know, you had 2013 cold, which is not even a good year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=591.4s	591.4	 Just FYI. OK, 2012. OK, 2015.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=595.3s	595.3	 I mean, so anyways, I thought it was a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=598.2s	598.2	 I stormed up and I left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=600.8s	600.8	 He did rage quit and it was quite a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=603.5s	603.5	 Because we're playing P.L.O.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=604.9s	604.9	 Finally, Saks loses all his money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=607.3s	607.3	 May I respond?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=705.7s	705.7	 And here's the reality at your mouth is you were very quiet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=710.1s	710.1	 and sort of sullen the whole night from the time you got there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=713.5s	713.5	 Kind of true. You didn't really participate in the conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=715.7s	715.7	 And Sky hypothesized that the reason why you were so withdrawn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=720.1s	720.1	 is because you were upset that the game had moved from your place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=723.7s	723.7	 to my place. And you thought somehow I was trying to hijack your game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=726.8s	726.8	 which is not true. We do a game at my place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=728.7s	728.7	 Maybe. No, no, no. I told Sky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=730.1s	730.1	 No, no, no. I told I told Sky text already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=732.3s	732.3	 I said, hey, guys, we normally run the game Thursdays at my house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=735.0s	735.0	 I'm happy to come up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=735.9s	735.9	 But it's harder for me because that's almost due. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=739.3s	739.3	 So you were upset from the get go that you were.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=745.4s	745.4	 Friedberg and Saks have not come to the last three games at your month's house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=749.4s	749.4	 Is there something going on here? Is it just the commute?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=751.9s	751.9	 I think the commute is hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=753.1s	753.1	 I mean, in fairness to you guys, it's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=754.8s	754.8	 I only missed the last game. I went.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=759.5s	759.5	 Is there something going on, Saks, where you can't know anymore?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=762.4s	762.4	 You have to mean it's either the commute or sometimes out of town, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=766.2s	766.2	 So you were in town the last couple of times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=768.0s	768.0	 I don't know. I think it's kind of you and Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=769.5s	769.5	 Maybe we need to go for a walk.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=867.3s	867.3	 And a bunch of technologists looked at the source code just by doing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=904.0s	904.0	 The value of the thing is like closer to Donald Trump is closer to 20 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=908.8s	908.8	 because there's a one point seven billion dollar value if they hit certain stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=911.8s	911.8	 prices according to the press release they put out, but there's not a good SEC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=914.7s	914.7	 filing on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=915.8s	915.8	 So at one point seven, that means he got one hundred seventy million shares,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=919.8s	919.8	 which are now worth, let's say, at one hundred and fifty seven dollars a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=922.6s	922.6	 Donald Trump has effectively 20 plus billion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=927.6s	927.6	 Oh, so he's finally a billionaire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=929.3s	929.3	 And he's finally a billionaire of equity value in his stake in this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=931.8s	931.8	 Actually, a billionaire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=932.6s	932.6	 And I think this and this is the absolute like penultimate NFT.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=937.4s	937.4	 It is traded against a caricature that is a one of a kind, completely rare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=943.9s	943.9	 This is going to all of his quote unquote media IP is going to be licensed into this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=948.4s	948.4	 stack. And so if you want to own a piece of it, this is the way to own it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=952.4s	952.4	 And people are trading it like an index on the Donald Trump character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=957.4s	957.4	 It's a it's an index on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=959.2s	959.2	 I think it's a it's an index on the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=962.6s	962.6	 I think it's an index on an alternative to Fox News, to traditional media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=967.5s	967.5	 the traditional media. It's a huge fuck you to actually the mainstream media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=970.7s	970.7	 I think this is going to Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=972.4s	972.4	 Oh, my God, it's going to tilt the hell out of like the folks that write at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=977.5s	977.5	 New York Times. My gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=979.1s	979.1	 Jack Dorsey's tweet, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=981.0s	981.0	 No, I got to I'll put it in the chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=983.5s	983.5	 But he kind of he made a comment on it after there was a screenshot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=987.2s	987.2	 And let's be honest, it's a grift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=989.3s	989.3	 I mean, this is just this is the ultimate peak grift in the peak bubble of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=993.3s	993.3	 lifetime period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=995.1s	995.1	 I think it's a vote like Peter Thiel said yesterday, you know, like Bitcoin is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=998.5s	998.5	 vote against the establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=999.8s	999.8	 This is a vote against the establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1001.8s	1001.8	 All right. What are the chances that an actual app launches sacks like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1006.0s	1006.0	 And when would that actually happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1007.5s	1007.5	 When can this crew of dipshits actually write a line of code and actually release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1012.4s	1012.4	 a product? You know how hard it is to release product?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1014.0s	1014.0	 Yeah, that's a good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1015.5s	1015.5	 I mean, what they're saying is that they're going to launch a new social network,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1019.5s	1019.5	 I guess, Twitter style called Truth Social.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1022.6s	1022.6	 And the primary interface will consist of a feed of short posts from users you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1026.6s	1026.6	 follow. Sounds familiar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1028.0s	1028.0	 However, these posts will be called truth instead of tweets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1031.7s	1031.7	 And reshares will be known as retruths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1034.3s	1034.3	 Wow. So that's what's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1036.9s	1036.9	 And the slide deck that's available on the company's website list, Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1041.9s	1041.9	 Facebook, Netflix, Disney Plus, CNN, iHeart Media, Google Cloud, Amazon Web
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1046.0s	1046.0	 Services, as some of TMTG's current and future competitors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1049.7s	1049.7	 So basically, you know, Trump is proposing an alternative to all the traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1056.7s	1056.7	 media and social networks that have basically banned him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1060.5s	1060.5	 But I do think that the trading here does represent there is, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1064.6s	1064.6	 a groundswell for social media platforms that are not controlled by big tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1071.1s	1071.1	 And, you know, Trump has 70 million tech voters, sorry, 70 million voters of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1075.9s	1075.9	 those, probably 30 to 40 million, you would say, would be fans of his on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1081.1s	1081.1	 social media. He's been banned from Twitter and Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1084.1s	1084.1	 And this is his response. He's created his own platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1087.6s	1087.6	 I don't know whether it will ultimately be successful, but I think what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1090.8s	1090.8	 seeing here is the demand for alternatives to, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1094.9s	1094.9	 censorious platforms that are controlled by big tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1097.4s	1097.4	 So if he has 30 million real fans, Chamath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1099.7s	1099.7	 what number of them would download the app and participate in the first year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1104.8s	1104.8	 He had 90 million followers on Twitter, J. Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1108.2s	1108.2	 That doesn't count.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1109.1s	1109.1	 But that's half of the Twitter registered accounts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1111.4s	1111.4	 We had 70 million people vote for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1113.1s	1113.1	 So what are the real fans, not just Republicans who don't want Hillary?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1116.7s	1116.7	 I don't think that's the way to think about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 I would I would view this as differently than this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1122.0s	1122.0	 What's what's insane is you have this entity here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1125.4s	1125.4	 which is essentially a cash shell that's now basically, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1129.5s	1129.5	 300 odd million dollars of cash, plus what looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1134.1s	1134.1	 18 or 19 billion dollars of brand value, like of intangible goodwill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1139.5s	1139.5	 And the sum total of that is is what the total market cap of this thing is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1142.6s	1142.6	 So if it is 18 billion, then that's what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1145.6s	1145.6	 What this allows them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1147.0s	1147.0	 And this is where it kind of gets interesting is these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1150.6s	1150.6	 What it shows me is they could come back and actually raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1153.2s	1153.2	 an enormous amount of money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1155.0s	1155.0	 They could issue, you know, a secondary stock sale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 They could do a convert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1159.0s	1159.0	 They could raise billions of dollars because the demand is there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1162.0s	1162.0	 And then with those billions of dollars, they could actually do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1164.8s	1164.8	 something really meaningful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1166.3s	1166.3	 They could go and acquire an existing app.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1168.7s	1168.7	 Jason Collin, you could acquire engineers and a product that already exists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1172.0s	1172.0	 They could be acquired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1173.4s	1173.4	 They could acquire a traditional broadcast outlet and give Trump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1177.7s	1177.7	 you know, a way to short circuit his launch of a Fox competitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1181.5s	1181.5	 So I actually think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1184.7s	1184.7	 This is a huge vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1186.2s	1186.2	 I think David's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1187.1s	1187.1	 It's a vote against censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1188.8s	1188.8	 It's a vote for Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1190.7s	1190.7	 It's a vote for the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1192.2s	1192.2	 It's a vote for alternative voices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1195.6s	1195.6	 And as a result, I think a lot of folks in the mainstream who have Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1201.1s	1201.1	 derangement syndrome are now going to be, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1204.2s	1204.2	 reawoken and in complete full tilt for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1207.8s	1207.8	 Yeah, it's pretty tilty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1209.1s	1209.1	 TMTG plus will be, you know, terrible branding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1213.2s	1213.2	 But the TMTG plus is looking this year already tilted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 I'm super. I'm not tilted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1218.7s	1218.7	 I mean, I think the whole thing is just a super grift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1221.0s	1221.0	 I don't think they'll ever get a product out the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1222.5s	1222.5	 And if they do, I think they get to maybe five, 10 million years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1225.6s	1225.6	 They're going to raise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 J.K.L., they've got they've got a 20 billion dollar market cap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1229.2s	1229.2	 They could do whatever the hell they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1230.4s	1230.4	 It's all people just manipulating the stock like they could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1233.0s	1233.0	 Like Chimot said, they could turn that into into cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1235.2s	1235.2	 We'll see. I mean, they could turn a billion of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1237.2s	1237.2	 I don't think they can get the 20 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1239.0s	1239.0	 Trump today in one day is worth more than two times in New York Times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1244.9s	1244.9	 Can you imagine what's going on in the New York Times right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1247.8s	1247.8	 Yeah. And that's just brand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1249.4s	1249.4	 Well, let's see. I mean, not all these facts stay at one hundred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1251.8s	1251.8	 and fifty dollars a share, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1253.3s	1253.3	 So, so, Jake, I think you're right that people outside the tech industry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1256.7s	1256.7	 really underestimate how hard it is to build technology products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1260.0s	1260.0	 that are any good, you know, that have a good UI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1262.8s	1262.8	 They're delightful to users.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1264.3s	1264.3	 It does require real talent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1266.4s	1266.4	 And if you're not sort of from the industry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1268.4s	1268.4	 you don't even know what kind of talent you need to hire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1269.9s	1269.9	 However, I think your mouth has a really good point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1272.3s	1272.3	 that with this kind of market cap, they could acquire their way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1275.8s	1275.8	 to a portfolio of assets like, for example, OK, rumble right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1280.7s	1280.7	 has become the alternative to YouTube among.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1284.2s	1284.2	 Yeah. Not just conservatives, but anyone who's who's been deplatformed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1287.5s	1287.5	 There's a lot of leftists now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1288.6s	1288.6	 There's locals dot com that you invested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1290.8s	1290.8	 Yes, exactly. I invested in locals, which is Dave Rubin's thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1294.1s	1294.1	 So but but just to take rumble for a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1296.2s	1296.2	 it's kind of the YouTube competitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1298.0s	1298.0	 You know, they've got something like 30 million users plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1301.8s	1301.8	 It's a very it's a it's a pretty big and growing audience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1305.4s	1305.4	 But there is locals. There are other assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1307.7s	1307.7	 And you could and I think the last valuation of rumble,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1310.2s	1310.2	 I think it was announced when Peter Thiel actually invested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1312.9s	1312.9	 I think it was around a five hundred million dollar valuation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1315.8s	1315.8	 Even if you paid a gigantic premium to that, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1318.2s	1318.2	 if your market cap is 20 billion, you could spend two billion on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1321.3s	1321.3	 You could spend five billion on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 Yeah. You know, and by the way, sorry, just to dispel this idea,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1326.7s	1326.7	 you don't need good UI if you have the right feature set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1330.0s	1330.0	 And Reddit is the perfect example where they have always been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1333.8s	1333.8	 on the side of free speech and they've always been on the side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1337.7s	1337.7	 of allowing people to vocalize and pursue their own passions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1341.5s	1341.5	 even if some of those things were really, you know, for the mainstream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1346.2s	1346.2	 beyond the pale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1347.6s	1347.6	 Their UI is terrible, but they have thrived because that single feature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1352.2s	1352.2	 dominates any desire for elegant UI.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1354.6s	1354.6	 And so I think what you're going to find over this next iteration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1358.3s	1358.3	 of these apps is how valuable free speech is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1360.7s	1360.7	 And there are enough examples, whether it's rumble or Reddit or others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1364.5s	1364.5	 that show you that the ability to not be censored dominates for Chan discord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1369.0s	1369.0	 They're all very similar. It's going to it's going to tweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1370.8s	1370.8	 It's going to tweak. Oh, my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1372.3s	1372.3	 The here's one thing I was saying, their defense super mega figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1375.4s	1375.4	 out how to do data analysis and marketing during his, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1380.2s	1380.2	 2016 campaign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1382.0s	1382.0	 And they did get that guy Pascal or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1384.4s	1384.4	 And they figured out Cambridge Analytica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1385.9s	1385.9	 So they did figure out how to get some tech people right, sacks to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1389.9s	1389.9	 you know, by the way, sorry, can I just say one thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1391.8s	1391.8	 The other super tilty thing is people will want to fade this trade and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1396.0s	1396.0	 you know, they're going to be silent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1397.4s	1397.4	 They're going to know they're going to be silently wishing for this thing to crater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1400.0s	1400.0	 And I think there's going to be a lot of profit taking on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1402.3s	1402.3	 because I think it's very speculative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1405.1s	1405.1	 But I think we will all be shocked at the actual closing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1409.1s	1409.1	 enterprise value when this thing these backs because it will these back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1412.5s	1412.5	 And we're all going to kind of scratch our heads thinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1415.4s	1415.4	 how did we not see this? I mean, I didn't see this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1417.7s	1417.7	 I would have never.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1418.6s	1418.6	 And there's going to be at least a billion dollars of cash available
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1421.2s	1421.2	 when they do their second. At least at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1423.2s	1423.2	 I mean, they can do whatever they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1424.8s	1424.8	 Yeah. They're going to have more more cash available to them to invest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1428.0s	1428.0	 And then your key is he is firmly back in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1431.9s	1431.9	 And by the way, one of the comments Garamucci made this morning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1435.8s	1435.8	 it's a very astute one, which is I'm rooting for the SPAC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1438.9s	1438.9	 because if this actually does the SPAC at this valuation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1441.7s	1441.7	 Donald Trump is not running for president again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1443.9s	1443.9	 because he's now got a 20 billion dollar media business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1446.2s	1446.2	 or 20 million dollars of equity value in this new media business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1448.4s	1448.4	 that he's going to keep running.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1450.0s	1450.0	 Saks, what do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1451.9s	1451.9	 That could be a win win for the Republican Party.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1456.0s	1456.0	 But you're buying the stock, you're joining the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1458.1s	1458.1	 Saks is leading the bait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1461.0s	1461.0	 Yeah, I mean, I think Chamath raised a good point that sites like Reddit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1465.4s	1465.4	 have shown that, you know, like a beautiful UI is not necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1469.3s	1469.3	 the feature that users want in every case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1471.9s	1471.9	 I do think you still have to have some tech talent involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1475.4s	1475.4	 in order to produce a good product. Just to give you an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1478.2s	1478.2	 So this product wasn't supposed to have its soft launch until next month,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1481.6s	1481.6	 but somehow some users found a way to access the site
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1484.3s	1484.3	 and they were setting up accounts within hours of the announcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1487.2s	1487.2	 So one vandal claimed the at Donald J.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1490.0s	1490.0	 Trump handle and posted a picture of a pig with extremely large testicles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1495.5s	1495.5	 So, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1498.0s	1498.0	 Now, I would just submit that you at least need to have enough tech talent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1501.2s	1501.2	 to prevent something like that from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1502.9s	1502.9	 Yes. I mean, maybe it wasn't a vandal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1505.9s	1505.9	 I mean, maybe Trump posted that photo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1508.4s	1508.4	 I don't know. It's not impossible. It's on brand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1511.5s	1511.5	 But yeah. But but anyway, my point is they still have to assemble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1516.1s	1516.1	 the tech talent to build this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1517.4s	1517.4	 Or I like the idea better of just acquiring the collection of assets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1521.8s	1521.8	 that they need. And I think you're right. I think it's multifaceted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1524.7s	1524.7	 I think it's a social network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1526.5s	1526.5	 A lot of Twitter. I think it's probably some sort of video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1529.2s	1529.2	 Do not underestimate the number of people in Wall Street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1533.9s	1533.9	 who are on the right and who will help these guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1538.9s	1538.9	 make very good decisions, even if they do it sort of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1543.5s	1543.5	 quote unquote clandestinely, meaning they'll never be on the cover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1546.5s	1546.5	 of helping them do a big M&A or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1549.3s	1549.3	 But there are there are a lot of those folks that will help make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1553.2s	1553.2	 that this dispatch cleanly that they have access to capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1557.5s	1557.5	 that they know how to go and raise and tap the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1560.5s	1560.5	 And what's beautiful about the public markets and you can say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1563.2s	1563.2	 this is an issue, but it's not in this case, is that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1567.7s	1567.7	 you can go on and basically support this guy in a way that's relatively anonymous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1572.1s	1572.1	 because it's not like you have to disclose that you own this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1574.5s	1574.5	 if you're if you're a private investor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1575.8s	1575.8	 So I think that he's back in the game in a big way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1580.3s	1580.3	 And I think this is going to really shake up the media landscape
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1582.8s	1582.8	 if they can execute well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1584.1s	1584.1	 They just need to think about this as an M&A vehicle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1586.7s	1586.7	 not as an engineering and product creation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1588.7s	1588.7	 Yes, 100 percent agree. 100 percent agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1590.7s	1590.7	 So would you sell Colin for a billion dollars in equity value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1594.4s	1594.4	 at one hundred dollars a share to these guys today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1596.0s	1596.0	 Yes, I can answer on his behalf. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1599.8s	1599.8	 I'm in it. Is that what you were doing on the phone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1601.4s	1601.4	 20 X left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1603.4s	1603.4	 No, I'll take 20 X in eight months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1606.0s	1606.0	 Jake, you want to be my agent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1608.6s	1608.6	 I think you have a quicker line to Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1611.1s	1611.1	 No, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1612.5s	1612.5	 I think actually this might be like to Peter Till's point, like maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1615.6s	1615.6	 don't take the product literally, but take the market cap seriously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1621.5s	1621.5	 because this is a lot of if they can keep even a five billion dollar market up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1626.3s	1626.3	 I do agree that does make them dangerous in terms of buying assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1629.9s	1629.9	 And I do think they can get the first five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1631.6s	1631.6	 All of these right wing services get five to he gets five to 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1634.9s	1634.9	 million people to sign up for him, even his like signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1637.4s	1637.4	 He was at like a million, you know, very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1640.3s	1640.3	 He's got like a signal or telegram group, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1642.5s	1642.5	 And he got to me. He could buy maybe he could buy Ben Shapiro's daily caller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1646.2s	1646.2	 That's a big media brand on the right that people listen to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1649.5s	1649.5	 Yeah. And keep Ben Shapiro there to run it because Trump needs operators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1654.5s	1654.5	 And the more disruptive thing isn't to buy stuff on the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1657.1s	1657.1	 It's to buy stuff in the center or even stuff on the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1659.8s	1659.8	 Again, it's very hard if you're a public company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1662.8s	1662.8	 It's impossible, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1664.4s	1664.4	 If Trump Media Group now has a currency and tries to acquire assets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1670.7s	1670.7	 the directors have a fiduciary responsibility to actually vote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1674.7s	1674.7	 in favor of that deal because they're not allowed to look at who the buyer is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1678.0s	1678.0	 and say, no, we don't want to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1680.3s	1680.3	 So if he puts out a reasonable fair market offer price, you know, of the closing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1684.3s	1684.3	 price plus 30, 35 percent, there is not a single public market director in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1688.5s	1688.5	 I don't care how Democrat tick they are or how much of a donor they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1693.9s	1693.9	 They'll always vote the deal because otherwise they will get personally sued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1697.2s	1697.2	 And that's the liability in public market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1698.8s	1698.8	 So I would be very careful about this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1701.3s	1701.3	 This thing is going to get really serious really quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1703.7s	1703.7	 I wonder if there's a tent pole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1707.3s	1707.3	 media personality that he could acquire in the same way Spotify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1710.7s	1710.7	 got Joe Rogan and Netflix got Dave Chappelle back to South
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1714.2s	1714.2	 somebody they could offer a hundred million dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1716.2s	1716.2	 They shouldn't do that. They should do what Sax just said, which is that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1719.0s	1719.0	 that that list of like the dumpster fire on Facebook every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1722.2s	1722.2	 which is like Dan Bunigno and Ben Shapiro and blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1725.8s	1725.8	 He should just go and get all those guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1727.3s	1727.3	 Yeah, that's what I just said. Round them up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1728.5s	1728.5	 But I wonder if there is like a comedian, you know, like, you know, Bill Mars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1731.8s	1731.8	 obviously hates him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1732.6s	1732.6	 But then is there somebody in the middle who is like a notable comedian on the right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1736.7s	1736.7	 Sax, I'm not fully vetted on your right buddies, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1741.2s	1741.2	 who's in that alt-right cohort that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1743.7s	1743.7	 Well, I think there's there's comics who are willing to be politically correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1747.3s	1747.3	 and non-woke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1748.9s	1748.9	 So I think that what's his name, like Bill Burr or something like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1751.9s	1751.9	 Is isn't he? Yeah, Bill Burr is net team Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1754.5s	1754.5	 But yeah, I wonder if a Bill Burr. He hates Trump, though, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1757.5s	1757.5	 Or it was a guy who got canceled for exposing himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1761.5s	1761.5	 Yeah, Louis C.K. Louis C.K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1763.5s	1763.5	 I mean, I'm not saying he's conservative, right? But, you know, no, he's available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1768.0s	1768.0	 Those guys, he's highly available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1770.1s	1770.1	 So, I mean, actually, one thing to think about is, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1772.4s	1772.4	 Trump got all these people to do like the monthly twenty five dollar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1776.8s	1776.8	 reoccurring subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1778.4s	1778.4	 And we got a little bit of trouble for that because people didn't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1780.2s	1780.2	 they were signing up for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1781.3s	1781.3	 But I wonder if he could get a million people or five million people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1783.9s	1783.9	 to pay ten bucks a month for the sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1786.2s	1786.2	 Yeah, absolutely. If there's something there behind the curtain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1789.6s	1789.6	 I mean, if it's nothing but like, I don't know, a newsletter of his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1793.7s	1793.7	 like extemporaneous tweets, I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1796.4s	1796.4	 But if there's real content there from people they care about, why wouldn't they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1800.8s	1800.8	 Wait a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1801.4s	1801.4	 What if he just did every Friday night a rally on a video service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1805.1s	1805.1	 where he just did one of his two or three hour stand up routines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1807.3s	1807.3	 and had different people come up and talk like his pillow guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1810.1s	1810.1	 and all of his other weirdos?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1812.1s	1812.1	 I think this could be like the I think this could be like the Oprah Winfrey network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1815.7s	1815.7	 where she may like anchor the temple show or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1818.9s	1818.9	 But there's a lot of other creators on the network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1820.9s	1820.9	 I think that's the opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1822.1s	1822.1	 Yes. The question the question, quite frankly, though, is whether he's operational
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1825.4s	1825.4	 enough to actually drive to these outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1827.8s	1827.8	 I think it's very easy for us to imagine what you could do with $20 billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1831.5s	1831.5	 and his media brand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1832.9s	1832.9	 And the question is just does this get executed that way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1835.9s	1835.9	 Now, does it's not going to be a real estate sugar guy from Florida
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1839.9s	1839.9	 that's going to manage this thing to an outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1841.8s	1841.8	 Does Twitter then let him back on the platform if he has this competing platform?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1846.0s	1846.0	 Does Facebook? How does that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1846.9s	1846.9	 No, I think I think at that point, they have the perfect excuse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1849.0s	1849.0	 not to let him back on, which is like, hey, we're not censoring him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1851.7s	1851.7	 because there's an alternative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1854.6s	1854.6	 They don't want to let him back on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1856.2s	1856.2	 In a way, I guess you have to ask yourself if Twitter had let him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1859.3s	1859.3	 come back on and gave him his platform back after like a six month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1862.0s	1862.0	 or a year timeout, would he even be doing this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1864.6s	1864.6	 No, he says he has a press announcement where he says that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1869.3s	1869.3	 I mean, he says here that Trump Media and Technology Group's mission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1872.9s	1872.9	 is to create a rival to the liberal media consortium and fight back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 against the big tech companies in Silicon Valley, which have user unilateral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1879.3s	1879.3	 power to silence opposing voices in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1882.2s	1882.2	 This is what's given him the opportunity is their censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1885.5s	1885.5	 Their censorship just created a 20 billion dollar war chest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1890.0s	1890.0	 I mean, the most tilting thing of this whole conversation is it's worth

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1894.7s	1894.7	 So I've been saying on the show for over a year that censorship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1898.0s	1898.0	 backfires in ways you can't expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1900.2s	1900.2	 They never think through the second or third order consequences of their censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1903.5s	1903.5	 It's like when Angela Merkel came out and said, hey, like, wait, did Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1907.4s	1907.4	 just deplatform ahead of state? Why are we depending on them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1910.3s	1910.3	 I mean, there's all these second or third order consequences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1912.5s	1912.5	 they never think through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1913.7s	1913.7	 And now they're coming back to bite them in the ass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1916.1s	1916.1	 Yeah, I mean, forcing people to get vaccines is now leading to whatever

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1924.2s	1924.2	 And that's causing a bit of bedlam in the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1927.6s	1927.6	 As we talked about all these authoritarian tendencies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1930.1s	1930.1	 create a backlash of some kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1931.8s	1931.8	 And if our ruling elites would just have a lighter hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1935.5s	1935.5	 there'd be a lot less tension in the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1937.5s	1937.5	 We had an interesting discussion last night at during.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1940.7s	1940.7	 But I think it was on the other side of the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1942.0s	1942.0	 So maybe you two didn't hear it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1943.4s	1943.4	 But we were talking about is Biden going to run again in 2024?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1947.6s	1947.6	 And what would that look like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1948.6s	1948.6	 And I just said, I can't imagine Biden in a debate three years from now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1952.9s	1952.9	 Like he he doesn't seem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1955.9s	1955.9	 I don't want to be derogatory here, but he doesn't seem very crisp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1958.7s	1958.7	 the last time four years later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1960.7s	1960.7	 So what do we think of chances of Biden running in 2024,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1963.9s	1963.9	 chances of Trump running in 2024 with all this information?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1966.7s	1966.7	 And what would that look like? Zero and zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1969.0s	1969.0	 You're zero zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1970.3s	1970.3	 Freeburg, you even care? Nope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1972.9s	1972.9	 Yeah, I didn't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1973.7s	1973.7	 I look, I mean, I think Trump's going to run this 20 billion dollar media empire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1976.9s	1976.9	 and he's going to be happy doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1978.0s	1978.0	 And I think if it's not Biden, it's going to be a proxy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1981.6s	1981.6	 So it's not going to be too far off in terms of what the.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1987.1s	1987.1	 You're deep in this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1988.6s	1988.6	 Sax, you're hosting as people were talking about on Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1992.1s	1992.1	 and you tilted all of San Francisco or 90 percent of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1994.5s	1994.5	 You're hosting DeSantis for a fundraiser.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1997.4s	1997.4	 It's his first fundraiser for his reelection as governor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=1999.8s	1999.8	 He hasn't said anything about his plans in 2024.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2002.2s	2002.2	 It's way too early for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2003.7s	2003.7	 Do I think Biden or Trump could be on the ballot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2005.6s	2005.6	 I think it's 50-50 for both of them. All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2008.1s	2008.1	 But I would like to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2009.2s	2009.2	 But look, instead of having two 80 year olds running against each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2012.0s	2012.0	 I would like to see, say, two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2014.9s	2014.9	 40 something or just younger leaders, you know, giving America a real choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2020.5s	2020.5	 All right. Where do we want to jump off to now? Venture capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2023.9s	2023.9	 Venture capital, because clearly Sax is is having extraordinary

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2031.5s	2031.5	 Freeburg money is not made, it's simply transferred from one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2034.2s	2034.2	 perception to another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2036.1s	2036.1	 One perception to another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2038.5s	2038.5	 It's a Wall Street speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2041.4s	2041.4	 Sax was like in his.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2043.0s	2043.0	 He was in his Gordon Gekko shirt last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2044.8s	2044.8	 He was doing monologues from Wall Street last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2046.5s	2046.5	 He was leaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2047.1s	2047.1	 He was leaving the poker table to go to into his soundproof chamber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2050.9s	2050.9	 that oversees his estate next to the poker room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2053.6s	2053.6	 And from there, he was on his phone, screaming, pacing back and forth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2056.7s	2056.7	 doing deals, gecko style.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2058.6s	2058.6	 He had his 300 pound trader next to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2061.3s	2061.3	 He was placing orders and something's going on in the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2065.3s	2065.3	 I mean, Sax, you know, do tell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2066.8s	2066.8	 But clearly the the venture liquidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2071.6s	2071.6	 waterfall that's going on right now is playing into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2073.7s	2073.7	 Well, it's it is bonkers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2075.5s	2075.5	 Wait, we got to show that chart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2077.5s	2077.5	 We should talk about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2079.1s	2079.1	 Highlight the statistics, Jake, because it is truly extraordinary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2081.6s	2081.6	 how much liquidity venture firms are having this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2084.2s	2084.2	 All right. Well, just to look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2086.4s	2086.4	 the value of US venture back companies that went public or were acquired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2090.4s	2090.4	 290 billion, 280 billion in 19 and 20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2094.3s	2094.3	 And then this year, 2021 so far, we're at 590 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2099.1s	2099.1	 It's literally doubled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2099.9s	2099.9	 But if you look back, it was but 110 billion in 2018.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2104.6s	2104.6	 So we are now five, six X where we were five years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2108.8s	2108.8	 And this is, again, the value of US venture US venture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2112.6s	2112.6	 back companies that went public or required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2114.4s	2114.4	 So the liquidity is bonkers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2116.2s	2116.2	 And we're seeing that in real estate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2119.0s	2119.0	 You know, jets being bought, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2120.9s	2120.9	 The VC industry has experienced three years of record breaking exits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2125.1s	2125.1	 This is a Twitter user who tweeted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2127.0s	2127.0	 Twenty twenty one is obviously smashing all those levels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2129.6s	2129.6	 Yeah, I mean, for the last until the last three years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2133.2s	2133.2	 the previous 15, 20 years, the exits per year were in this 50 to 100 billion range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2138.3s	2138.3	 Then they've jumped up to 600 billion in the last year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2141.7s	2141.7	 And in the previous two years, it was 300 billion each.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2144.7s	2144.7	 So, yeah, I mean, it's just more money has has been made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2149.6s	2149.6	 or distributed out in the venture capital industry in the last three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2152.7s	2152.7	 I think the previous 20 years combined, at least the last three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2157.1s	2157.1	 Yeah, that doesn't that doesn't even factor in what's happening in crypto.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2161.7s	2161.7	 Right. And crypto is just like sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2163.8s	2163.8	 There's something to it here. Coinbase is in here as like like like in my portfolio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2167.8s	2167.8	 As an example, like, you know, like venture returns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2170.8s	2170.8	 which which have been excellent across the board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2172.6s	2172.6	 So forget mine, just everybody's venture value kind of like slowly ticks up over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2178.0s	2178.0	 Right. Because like, you know, you're doing this work and then that work gets valued
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2181.7s	2181.7	 and then somebody else comes in and raises a new round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2183.9s	2183.9	 And, you know, you hopefully can defend your pro rata, yada, yada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2188.0s	2188.0	 So it does create a lot of compounding value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2192.1s	2192.1	 But it's, you know, and it's relatively fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2195.0s	2195.0	 But compared to crypto, it's unbelievably slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2197.6s	2197.6	 Whereas in crypto, you know, quarter over quarter, you have these swings that I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2201.8s	2201.8	 I've personally never, ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2203.9s	2203.9	 Like I was telling you this story yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2205.8s	2205.8	 We own something which I'm not going to tell you what it is, but it's a crypto thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2210.2s	2210.2	 And our nav, I had to mark my book up a billion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2216.0s	2216.0	 net asset value on that asset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2217.5s	2217.5	 I had to mark it up because, you know, we have to submit to our auditors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2220.9s	2220.9	 and just keep an accurate sense of what our book value is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2224.3s	2224.3	 A billion dollars in a quarter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2227.0s	2227.0	 I've never seen that in my entire investing career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2229.0s	2229.0	 And here's how what it does to me and my whole team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2233.2s	2233.2	 I have a budget for next year of how much I want to spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2235.8s	2235.8	 Instantly, that number goes up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2238.0s	2238.0	 And what it really means is I'm probably just going to be getting the same ownership,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2241.8s	2241.8	 but I'm just going to be paying more for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2243.7s	2243.7	 And if I'm going through that, I think everybody's going to go through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2246.0s	2246.0	 And what it's going to do is it's like all of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2248.3s	2248.3	 All of these returns are great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2250.3s	2250.3	 All of these increases are great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2252.1s	2252.1	 But I'm not sure that there's going to be that much more progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2256.6s	2256.6	 There's not necessarily going to be that many more startups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2259.4s	2259.4	 because it's just harder and harder to find good things in the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2263.1s	2263.1	 for the same number of GPs in a place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2266.2s	2266.2	 And costs are going bananas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2268.6s	2268.6	 Salaries are off the charts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2271.6s	2271.6	 I don't know if you guys saw about Stripe, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2273.6s	2273.6	 there was a tweet about how Stripe starting to pay like starting engineers, 280K.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2278.7s	2278.7	 I don't know if that's true or not, but there was a tweet in Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2281.5s	2281.5	 And I thought to myself, my gosh, like 20 years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2284.4s	2284.4	 a starting engineering salary was 50, 60K in the Bay Area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2289.0s	2289.0	 And so you've seen this incredible price inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2290.9s	2290.9	 So it's actually quite good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2292.0s	2292.0	 Again, it's sort of what we talked about yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2294.2s	2294.2	 All of these gains eventually come back around and get recaptured.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2298.4s	2298.4	 And so I think that you're starting to see the beginning of this really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2301.5s	2301.5	 incredible cycle of wealth transfer, essentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2304.4s	2304.4	 So the funds may make it, but it's going to come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2307.5s	2307.5	 Let me ask you a question about the crypto stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2309.7s	2309.7	 Is there any worry there that these valuations match reality?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2314.2s	2314.2	 Because you might have a very small float on these, a lot of excitement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2318.4s	2318.4	 and they're not actually products being used by customers in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2321.9s	2321.9	 Here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2322.9s	2322.9	 Because it's an internal permanent pool of capital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2325.8s	2325.8	 I have no legal requirement to actually mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2330.2s	2330.2	 But the reason we do it is because we want to track NAV and AV and book value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2334.7s	2334.7	 And I compensate my team based on how well we compound book value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2340.4s	2340.4	 But you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2341.2s	2341.2	 It's a huge problem because I don't know how to get liquid on these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2347.6s	2347.6	 And so you see this thing sitting on your balance sheet and you're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2350.7s	2350.7	 what do we do with this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2351.7s	2351.7	 How do you move it around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2352.6s	2352.6	 You can't, you cannot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2354.3s	2354.3	 And so I would rather there's a there's a great guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2358.6s	2358.6	 He was an early pioneer of private equity, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2362.1s	2362.1	 he had this phrase which he said, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2364.2s	2364.2	 you know, the best way to mark up a deal is right at the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2368.3s	2368.3	 So if you put in, you know, $10 million into a series A,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2371.5s	2371.5	 if you could be allowed, the best thing to do would be carry that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2374.9s	2374.9	 at a $10 million value right until the minute you get liquid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2378.1s	2378.1	 Because then you don't go through the psychological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2380.8s	2380.8	 roller coaster ride of having to go through these marks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2383.4s	2383.4	 Because then when these marks come back down, Jason, to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2385.8s	2385.8	 they'll be they'll be a quarter where we give back that billion dollars of debt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2389.9s	2389.9	 Maybe, you know, I mean, what what do we all do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2393.3s	2393.3	 It's a huge mindfuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2394.3s	2394.3	 Let me ask a question about valuation, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2396.5s	2396.5	 When you're doing yours, because this came up when I was doing mine and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2399.5s	2399.5	 marking my funds, if a secondary transaction occurs and somebody buys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2404.4s	2404.4	 com or, you know, slack or whatever, it's the moment it's a private company
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2408.3s	2408.3	 at $10 a share, but the last time you purchased it, or there was a funding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2411.7s	2411.7	 two years ago, it was at $2 a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2414.4s	2414.4	 Where do you put the valuation at what the secondary market is trading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2418.1s	2418.1	 it at, or what you last paid for it or somewhere in between those?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2421.1s	2421.1	 And who makes that decision, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2422.5s	2422.5	 What is the best practice on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2424.0s	2424.0	 Because secondary market transactions, people are actually making a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2427.6s	2427.6	 transaction, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2428.5s	2428.5	 But is that as good as a venture firm, you know, plopping down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2432.8s	2432.8	 joining the board?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2433.6s	2433.6	 Obviously not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2434.1s	2434.1	 No, it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2434.6s	2434.6	 So first of all, you don't want to be making these decisions ad hoc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2437.6s	2437.6	 You want to have a policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2438.8s	2438.8	 So we have a written policy and there's a process for amending it if it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2442.2s	2442.2	 ever needs to be amended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2443.3s	2443.3	 And what our policy does is it just uses the most, the most recent preferred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2448.1s	2448.1	 round to give us the value of the shares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2452.0s	2452.0	 And then there can be adjustments based on market conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2455.5s	2455.5	 Like we know that it's usually on the downward, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2458.9s	2458.9	 Like the company we know has had a huge problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2461.5s	2461.5	 They're not going to fundraise again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2463.5s	2463.5	 So there's not going to be a new market anytime soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2465.8s	2465.8	 You're saying it's a zombie company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2467.0s	2467.0	 Yeah, it's a zombie company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2468.3s	2468.3	 We can, we can mark it down, but basically speaking, we use preferred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2472.0s	2472.0	 financing valuations to set marks only.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2475.4s	2475.4	 Now we do sometimes buy secondary shares and there's a methodology for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2479.0s	2479.0	 bringing a value on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2480.3s	2480.3	 Usually it's basically what we buy them at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2483.0s	2483.0	 And if we somehow otherwise own common, we'll use the 409A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2487.3s	2487.3	 That's what we do too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2488.0s	2488.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2488.9s	2488.9	 I think it's a really, really clean policy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2491.8s	2491.8	 You want to be conservative in these because nothing would be worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2494.7s	2494.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2494.9s	2494.9	 I think you have to be accurate, not conservative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2496.9s	2496.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2497.6s	2497.6	 Well, I mean, you could be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2500.3s	2500.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2500.5s	2500.5	 I guess the question is like you could see somebody playing some games where,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2504.7s	2504.7	 you know, you buy, you know, some shares at the, you own shares in the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2509.2s	2509.2	 You buy some shares in secondary and now you've got two marks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2511.9s	2511.9	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2512.0s	2512.0	 Embedded risk and venture capital has always been the following, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2515.0s	2515.0	 that you have money that goes in into the A and there is an incentive today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2519.5s	2519.5	 especially because so much money is trying to come in where you want to drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2523.8s	2523.8	 as much growth as possible, because then the B is at such a large step up that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2527.8s	2527.8	 the IRRs look amazing and then the C looks greater than the B.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2531.1s	2531.1	 So then everybody's quote unquote, making paper money, which allows you to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2536.6s	2536.6	 more incentives to raise more capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2539.2s	2539.2	 The problem with all of that is that if these valuations ever turn out to not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2542.2s	2542.2	 real or there's a valuation reset or there's inflation or the public markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2546.4s	2546.4	 don't value growth stocks, it takes a long time for it to work its way through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2550.4s	2550.4	 the venture ecosystem and all of this liquidity will probably make it even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2554.4s	2554.4	 more violent when it does happen because it'll eventually will happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2558.9s	2558.9	 We'll go through a rerating like the year 2000, who knows when it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2561.9s	2561.9	 and what the catalyst is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2563.3s	2563.3	 But that's the real downside of not of all of this is that it'll eventually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2568.9s	2568.9	 have a valuation reset that's going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2571.1s	2571.1	 And to make this super real for people, US venture capital funds have raised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2574.4s	2574.4	 a combined 69.1 billion in 2020, edging past the 2018 and a couple of these were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2580.6s	2580.6	 because of Andres and Horowitz doing a pair of mega funds with 4.5 billion in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2585.0s	2585.0	 commitments recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2587.3s	2587.3	 And so it's been just a tremendous amount of funds being made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2591.9s	2591.9	 And then to give you an example, clubhouse went from 100 million to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2595.8s	2595.8	 billion to 4 billion in under 18 months in valuation led, I think each time by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2600.1s	2600.1	 Andres and Horowitz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2601.6s	2601.6	 So what you're saying in an example like this, or in your hypothetical example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2605.2s	2605.2	 and I'll just make it a real world one, if they take those and by the way, these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2609.9s	2609.9	 are 2020, 2021, 2020 sets, I don't know what the 2021 sets are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2613.3s	2613.3	 So those are old stats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2614.1s	2614.1	 There's probably many more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2615.1s	2615.1	 I think actually I have the update sets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2617.6s	2617.6	 Funds have raised 96 billion for 2021.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2621.0s	2621.0	 That's the most update in fairness to all of the venture capitalists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2624.1s	2624.1	 I think that they're doing exactly what they should be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2627.5s	2627.5	 And in fairness to all the crossover funds right now is the time to be putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2632.0s	2632.0	 maximum money to work as fast as possible, not necessarily intelligently, not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2638.4s	2638.4	 necessarily in a concentrated way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2640.9s	2640.9	 But the real game, if you want to play it at the institutional level is to just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2644.9s	2644.9	 put all the chips on the table and then go back to the store and get some more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2649.2s	2649.2	 chips as quickly as possible, put them all on the table, come back and get more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2653.5s	2653.5	 So that when it all, you know, is said and done, you have as many dollars working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2658.9s	2658.9	 And the worst case is you will return the average return of the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2663.9s	2663.9	 And if that happens to be good, you're you look good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2666.6s	2666.6	 If it happens to be crappy, you'll be no worse, better worse off than anybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2670.5s	2670.5	 But meanwhile, you will have collected enormous fees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2673.7s	2673.7	 And so that's the point in the cycle we're at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2675.9s	2675.9	 And I think that anybody who's doing it makes a ton of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2679.0s	2679.0	 I think it's a really logical thing to be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2681.3s	2681.3	 The ones that have had big liquidity events are also retiring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2683.6s	2683.6	 I mean, we're seeing across the board, GPs of these ultra successful funds that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2687.5s	2687.5	 have returned 5X plus taking their key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2690.3s	2690.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2690.5s	2690.5	 And they got their carried interest and they share their 20, 25% share in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2695.6s	2695.6	 And they walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2696.5s	2696.5	 But if you look at the value of all global public equities, it's about, it's about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2703.9s	2703.9	 a hundred trillion dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2706.2s	2706.2	 And so if you're seeing, let's say that we're raising a hundred billion dollars a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2709.2s	2709.2	 year of venture capital in these funds, and then you're making a two and a half X
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2714.4s	2714.4	 average market return, which is not normal, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2716.9s	2716.9	 Let's assume that's the normal cycle we're in right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2719.8s	2719.8	 That's $250 billion of liquidity realized in a year out of a hundred trillion dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2726.7s	2726.7	 of global public equities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2728.4s	2728.4	 That's only a quarter of a percent of the disruption of public equities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2733.1s	2733.1	 And think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2733.8s	2733.8	 Technology is set up to disrupt all of these old school businesses that are public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2738.8s	2738.8	 and mature and scaled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2739.9s	2739.9	 And that's what the hundred trillion dollars represents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2742.2s	2742.2	 So it's actually, you know, kind of looking at it statistically, it's not that unfounded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2746.4s	2746.4	 that we're only seeing a quarter percent market cap disruption of public equities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2750.0s	2750.0	 each year, because those public companies aren't disrupting each other generally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2753.0s	2753.0	 Maybe to some extent they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2754.3s	2754.3	 They're getting disrupted by new companies that are emerging, new startups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2758.7s	2758.7	 And so I don't think that this is like necessarily the, you know, the peak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2762.8s	2762.8	 It may kind of be the beginning of a continuing disruption cycle that we're going to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2767.3s	2767.3	 kind of persist for the next decade or two, especially as more of the old school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2771.0s	2771.0	 industrial businesses, which make up a bulk of that market cap, start to get disrupted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2775.0s	2775.0	 not just by software, but also by automation, by ESG angle investing, by life sciences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2782.0s	2782.0	 and all these other kind of technologies that, and these interests, these market
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2785.4s	2785.4	 interests that are going to disrupt those old industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2787.2s	2787.2	 I think we could even see an acceleration from here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2789.4s	2789.4	 So, you know, I don't, I don't think that this is necessarily peak frenzied, bubbled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2794.3s	2794.3	 low interest rate fueled outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2795.9s	2795.9	 I think this may be kind of part of a longer term trend that is statistically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2799.2s	2799.2	 probably not that big a deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2800.9s	2800.9	 Sax, are you concerned about this peak bubbly market, or do you think, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2806.1s	2806.1	 like Tramot said, push all your chips in and raise as big a fund as you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2810.2s	2810.2	 And, you know, if the game is going to be played at these high stakes, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2813.9s	2813.9	 want to be at the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2815.8s	2815.8	 Well, I like what Freeberg said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2817.6s	2817.6	 I think it's a super interesting point that this could just be the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2820.9s	2820.9	 Look, we live in an age of accelerating technological progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2824.2s	2824.2	 So why wouldn't the returns from that accelerating technological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2827.8s	2827.8	 progress also be accelerating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2830.5s	2830.5	 You know, we, we had this thesis 20 years ago when the internet first started that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2835.0s	2835.0	 you had the new economy replaced the old economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2837.2s	2837.2	 It took a few years longer than people thought, but we are fully there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2840.4s	2840.4	 And the number of new companies being created now is just exploding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2844.8s	2844.8	 There is a lot of this, the, this liquidity that's being generated is being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2848.3s	2848.3	 now pumped into the next set of funds, which will go to founders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2851.6s	2851.6	 They'll be able to create more companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2853.6s	2853.6	 They'll be able to keep more of those companies because there'll be less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2857.1s	2857.1	 dilution and then a lot of this wealth is trickling, a lot of the VC money is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2861.5s	2861.5	 trickling down into the competition for salaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2863.9s	2863.9	 So anybody really anywhere in the world who can learn how to write code can now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2869.7s	2869.7	 you know, make a six figure plus salary because of remote work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2873.4s	2873.4	 So all the salaries all over the world are equilibrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2876.2s	2876.2	 So, I mean, this is an incredible pathway to prosperity for, I mean, certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2881.5s	2881.5	 the United States, but really the whole world for humanity, it's really positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2886.0s	2886.0	 Assuming it keeps going, assuming it's not just totally liquidity driven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2889.9s	2889.9	 And, you know, I don't know exactly, you know, how all those macro forces will play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2894.9s	2894.9	 out, but, but I mean, this seems very positive overall, the other, the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2900.2s	2900.2	 thing it'll lead to just quickly is a change in who has political power because,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2905.0s	2905.0	 you know, ultimately, you know, money is the mother's milk of politics and, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2908.1s	2908.1	 the people who are making all these returns will eventually fund politicians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2913.0s	2913.0	 And, and, you know, yeah, well, yeah, I'm one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2917.1s	2917.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2918.2s	2918.2	 But look, I think there's two kinds of, like I'd say prototypes, politically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2922.8s	2922.8	 speaking, for people in the technology world, you've kind of got the sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2927.4s	2927.4	 standard woke progressives who are funding a lot of this crazy stuff like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2931.8s	2931.8	 decarceration cities, whatever we talked about that before, but I also think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2934.7s	2934.7	 there's another prototype that's less loud and they feel that they're, they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2939.0s	2939.0	 kind of keep their views more to themselves, which is I call them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2942.2s	2942.2	 libertarians who are sort of liberal on social values, but libertarian on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2947.3s	2947.3	 economic policy, they don't like government regulations, certainly if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2951.2s	2951.2	 they're in the crypto world, they don't like government regulations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2953.9s	2953.9	 They could see how they create, you know, friction to progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2957.5s	2957.5	 And they believe in markets and, and they will, I think they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2961.3s	2961.3	 want to fund politicians who support that, those types of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2965.1s	2965.1	 So, you know, I could be very positive politically in that respect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2969.2s	2969.2	 What's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2969.9s	2969.9	 I just want to build on what you built on what Friedberg said, which is, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2973.5s	2973.5	 think the best point you made was look on a global basis of the opportunity for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2977.7s	2977.7	 an individual, somebody who is, you know, graduating high school, college,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2981.4s	2981.4	 they're 18, 19, 20 years old because of remote work, anybody can work from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2985.1s	2985.1	 anywhere. Technology companies have unlimited resources and they need an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2990.7s	2990.7	 never ending supply of developers or even a SaaS salesperson, a marketer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2995.6s	2995.6	 you know, back office, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=2996.9s	2996.9	 And they can work from anywhere on the globe and make a six figure salary,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3000.1s	3000.1	 you know, whatever 50, 60, 70, 80 K for one of these entry level jobs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3003.9s	3003.9	 sales and all the information on how to get those jobs is available for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3009.2s	3009.2	 from startups that have put open courseware online or very free courses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3013.2s	3013.2	 Yet we're looking at this massive technological change and the New York
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3016.5s	3016.5	 Times is position is that technology is destroying humanity and polarization of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3021.1s	3021.1	 wealth is destroying humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3022.8s	3022.8	 What we're actually uncovering here is all of this money being invested in these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3026.4s	3026.4	 companies is giving an opportunity for people around the world to get high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3030.0s	3030.0	 paying jobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3031.1s	3031.1	 Totally. And actually, can I, can I, can I, let me mention a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3034.7s	3034.7	 interesting item in that was just in Politico today, which was about, um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3038.8s	3038.8	 Al Sharpton was lobbying in Congress against changing the carried interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3045.3s	3045.3	 treatment. So remember, you know, all of us in VC make our compensation in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3049.4s	3049.4	 form of a carried interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3053.2s	3053.2	 Well, it's basically, you know, if a fund is in profits that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3057.5s	3057.5	 the VC will get the VC's firm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3060.3s	3060.3	 we'll get say 25% of the upside after they pay back all their LPs that's called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3064.6s	3064.6	 the carried interest because of the way that these partnerships are set up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3067.8s	3067.8	 that is treated as a capital gains as opposed to ordinary income,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3071.9s	3071.9	 assuming it meets the holding periods of the underlying assets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3075.0s	3075.0	 So there's a big debate about whether, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3077.9s	3077.9	 VCs and private equity people should be paying ordinary income or long-term cap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3082.0s	3082.0	 gains on those returns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3084.6s	3084.6	 Al Sharpton was lobbying against changing it because in this political,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3088.7s	3088.7	 Politico article,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3089.8s	3089.8	 he was saying that it would impede the efforts of black entrepreneurs to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3094.2s	3094.2	 lasting wealth if you jacked up the tax rates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3097.0s	3097.0	 because there's a lot of fund managers and you know, who,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3100.8s	3100.8	 who are black, who are making a lot of money now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3103.8s	3103.8	 and they don't want to be subject to this change in treatment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3106.4s	3106.4	 So that was super interesting. You know, this tech boom is not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3111.3s	3111.3	 it's not exclusive. I mean, the tech industry gets this rap as if it's this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3115.2s	3115.2	 highly exclusionary place. It's not, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3118.0s	3118.0	 three of the people on this pod right now are immigrants. So, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3121.3s	3121.3	 the wealth that's being created is not going to traditional centers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3125.8s	3125.8	 traditional, it's not going to the heirs of, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3129.8s	3129.8	 North Eastern, you know, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3132.1s	3132.1	 families or something who've been sending their kids to Harvard and Princeton
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3135.1s	3135.1	 for generations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3136.0s	3136.0	 It's going to entirely new people who haven't had this kind of wealth before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3140.2s	3140.2	 And that's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3141.5s	3141.5	 Another positive externality of this wealth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3143.6s	3143.6	 all these massive gains that folks who have invested in venture capital have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3148.6s	3148.6	 gotten has caused one really interesting positive change. So Amherst,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3153.7s	3153.7	 which is a really exclusive liberal arts college in the Northeast made so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3160.0s	3160.0	 money. Their endowment is so flush with cash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3162.5s	3162.5	 They basically eliminated a legacy admittances,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3166.5s	3166.5	 which means if your parents got in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3169.7s	3169.7	 you were 70% likely to get into Amherst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3174.0s	3174.0	 An equivalent kid whose parents didn't go to Amherst had a less than 6% chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3178.7s	3178.7	 of getting a 10% admit rate. Right? So huge disparity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3181.4s	3181.4	 basically said if you were a legacy kid that exists, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3184.0s	3184.0	 we all know this it exists at Harvard, it exists at all these Ivy league schools,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3187.9s	3187.9	 but Amherst is now so has made so much money through VC investments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3191.4s	3191.4	 As an example, they're like, we've canceled admittances. So there's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3195.4s	3195.4	 there are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3195.9s	3195.9	 there are some really positive things that are happening with all this money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3198.5s	3198.5	 that's being made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3199.6s	3199.6	 Al Sharpton's rationale aside, um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3203.1s	3203.1	 anyone's going to get wealthier if they're paying less taxes. So I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3207.4s	3207.4	 you know, you're broadly, you're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3208.7s	3208.7	 you're going to see a bit of a focus on that point. Obviously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3211.5s	3211.5	 which is why Cal Freeburg California was massively in the bonus in terms of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3216.1s	3216.1	 budget surplus and cash because of this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3219.5s	3219.5	 And they were spending money like drunken sailors. Yeah. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3222.3s	3222.3	 I just think you're going to hear a lot of positioning for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3227.1s	3227.1	 you know, the case. And by the way, I think that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3229.5s	3229.5	 building individual wealth creates, this is obviously a philosophical point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3234.4s	3234.4	 but you know, it creates a greater path to prosperity for more people, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3238.5s	3238.5	 through the spending that they'll under do and growing the economy than, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3242.7s	3242.7	 than not. So I don't know. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3244.5s	3244.5	 I feel like the Al Sharpton point is a good one to kind of make,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3246.9s	3246.9	 but it's a broader one than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3248.7s	3248.7	 Well, I think in my view,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3250.1s	3250.1	 the broader point about the Sharpton thing is that it shows that we talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3254.0s	3254.0	 this group of rich people, the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3257.8s	3257.8	 as if it's a static class of people, at least this is the progressive attack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3261.3s	3261.3	 It's not, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3262.2s	3262.2	 what Sharpton points to is that this group is constantly changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3265.2s	3265.2	 There's new people getting rich. So when we talk about the rich,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3268.2s	3268.2	 if it's new people getting rich, what we're really talking about is success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3272.1s	3272.1	 And if you really want to ban people getting rich, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3275.3s	3275.3	 you're talking about banning success. Our country can't be successful that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3278.9s	3278.9	 We're not going to be able to out-compete China if we're preventing success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3282.1s	3282.1	 And by the way, we can't fund all these progressive, uh, programs if we are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3286.4s	3286.4	 you know, hamstringing success. So, um, you know, I think this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3291.2s	3291.2	 what we've created here with this highly entrepreneurial free enterprise system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3294.8s	3294.8	 that's funded by venture capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3296.2s	3296.2	 This is the golden goose of the American economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3299.3s	3299.3	 And the most important thing is that we don't break it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3301.4s	3301.4	 Sax, it might just be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3303.1s	3303.1	 we may have underestimated its power is what we're sort of realizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3306.7s	3306.7	 collectively here today is that we've always thought that this thing is hitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3310.1s	3310.1	 all time highs. This might be the beginning, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3313.3s	3313.3	 Like it feels like this is getting bigger and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3316.9s	3316.9	 and going at a velocity that is different than even when we came into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3320.3s	3320.3	 industry, you know, the amount of exits, the amount, the scale of these companies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3324.0s	3324.0	 the coin bases, the Robin hoods, the Uber's, the slacks. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3327.3s	3327.3	 these are giant companies making huge international impacts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3331.1s	3331.1	 I think it's either that or this whole thing is liquidity driven bubbles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3334.1s	3334.1	 So it's one of the two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3336.3s	3336.3	 It's both. It's both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3337.6s	3337.6	 Well, I also think the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3338.9s	3338.9	 the Sharpton thing is a very interesting point that we can go back to maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3342.3s	3342.3	 episode 25 or 20 when we started this podcast, which was Trump got massive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3347.6s	3347.6	 support from the black and Hispanic community because of this entrepreneurial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3351.3s	3351.3	 freedom, upward mobility pitch, the Republicans were making.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3356.0s	3356.0	 That's the perfect pitch for the Republicans, not this divisive, divisive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3360.6s	3360.6	 you know, shut the border down, but more, hey, we want everybody to support it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3364.6s	3364.6	 And I thought, how crazy is it was Michael Che?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3367.5s	3367.5	 Did you want to just add on this? And I'll give it to you, Trimah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3369.6s	3369.6	 Michael Che was on the breakfast club when our friend was hosting SNL.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3374.2s	3374.2	 And he said, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3376.1s	3376.1	 I think white people just don't like their billionaires for some reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3379.4s	3379.4	 It's weird because we love our billionaires.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3381.8s	3381.8	 If Oprah or Tyler Perry was coming, we'd be excited about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3384.9s	3384.9	 And I met Michael Che there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3386.8s	3386.8	 Michael Che was really excited. He's a fan of Elon's and like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3389.9s	3389.9	 it was a really great conversation they had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3391.8s	3391.8	 So true. It's so true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3393.3s	3393.3	 Like, why are we hating people who are changing the world and helping?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3397.6s	3397.6	 Right. Because it's not we it's it's frankly, it's a white woke progressives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3402.2s	3402.2	 They're crazy. They're the crazy ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3403.9s	3403.9	 They're bonkers. We have to get purple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3406.5s	3406.5	 I think conservatives and what you call woke progressives are the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3411.5s	3411.5	 I don't think it's about a political affinity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3413.8s	3413.8	 I think it is about people feeling like they don't have the opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3416.6s	3416.6	 that others clearly were able to realize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3418.9s	3418.9	 And it is amplified and magnified by the social media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3424.0s	3424.0	 that basically shines a light on the success that people have had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3427.0s	3427.0	 in a way that we've never had in history before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3429.7s	3429.7	 And it creates a great deal of feeling like I'm missing out and I'm being left out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3433.8s	3433.8	 And that's what's driving a lot of the discontent on both the left and 100 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3438.5s	3438.5	 It's not a political point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3440.3s	3440.3	 I think it's a social point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3441.9s	3441.9	 And the great progress we've had and the great success we've had as a society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3445.2s	3445.2	 over the past couple of decades is now being realized through this media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3448.9s	3448.9	 in a way that's kind of driving emotional conditions for people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3451.6s	3451.6	 that haven't had the same level of success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3453.4s	3453.4	 Maybe if they stop tweeting and complaining and just learn some skills like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3457.5s	3457.5	 I was complaining on Twitter only as the only colored person on this pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3461.5s	3461.5	 What I'll tell you is I it's very rare that I meet a colored person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3464.7s	3464.7	 that hates a successful other colored person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3467.7s	3467.7	 Just doesn't exist, guys. Tell us more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3470.3s	3470.3	 It's just one of these things where, you know, we were we are all grinding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3473.7s	3473.7	 We all know how hard it is to be on the outside looking in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3476.6s	3476.6	 If any one of us makes it, there's a lot of support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3480.5s	3480.5	 I mean, we see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3481.5s	3481.5	 That's just what I felt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3484.5s	3484.5	 South African youth don't feel that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3487.3s	3487.3	 No, I mean, we see that in the incoming emails and tweets to you, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3490.7s	3490.7	 You are inspiring people in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3494.5s	3494.5	 We see it constantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3495.6s	3495.6	 They come up to you at events and they're like, hey, if Chamath can figure this out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3498.5s	3498.5	 I can do I'm about to do this thing in Africa and I'm going there in December.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3502.3s	3502.3	 I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3503.0s	3503.0	 And, you know, we're thinking of just doing a couple of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3506.0s	3506.0	 lectures and talks and lectures and talks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3508.3s	3508.3	 And these these places are going to get rammed with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3511.5s	3511.5	 And it's like, it's beautiful to see, like, yeah, I just think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3515.1s	3515.1	 minorities like don't hate on other people that are successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3518.1s	3518.1	 It's just not you're going to Africa in December.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3520.6s	3520.6	 Yeah. Why don't we do all in Africa?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3522.6s	3522.6	 What are we doing? Like, where are you going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3524.1s	3524.1	 How many I guess I'm still cooking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3525.4s	3525.4	 I got some stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3526.1s	3526.1	 Hey, I'm getting email constantly by people who are starting startups in Africa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3530.8s	3530.8	 I want to go. I've never been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3532.1s	3532.1	 I really want you can come with me in early December if you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3534.7s	3534.7	 I'm in. I'm 100 percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3535.8s	3535.8	 I have nothing to do. I'm here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3536.9s	3536.9	 Something that I wanted to talk about before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3538.6s	3538.6	 What is crazy? And this is Jason to build on your Trump comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3542.0s	3542.0	 We may be facing a situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3543.8s	3543.8	 I'd love to get your guys reaction where Donald Trump in his first two years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3546.9s	3546.9	 of his presidency may actually have gotten more done than Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3551.2s	3551.2	 will get done in his first two years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3552.9s	3552.9	 And I just want your guys' reaction and thoughts on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3557.1s	3557.1	 how that possibly could be, because we have a Democratic president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3560.4s	3560.4	 We have a Democratic Congress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3562.8s	3562.8	 And we may not get anything done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3566.8s	3566.8	 I can speak to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3568.0s	3568.0	 Here's your alley oop with the windup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3571.1s	3571.1	 I can't believe that the way the progressives have done this reconciliation bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3575.3s	3575.3	 It's been crazy. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3576.7s	3576.7	 Look, from the beginning, they've been saying the Biden administration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3580.3s	3580.3	 the Democrats have been saying we want to do the biggest package of tax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3583.8s	3583.8	 expense since the Great Society. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3586.3s	3586.3	 But here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3588.1s	3588.1	 If you want to do LBJ type things, you got to have LBJ type majorities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3591.4s	3591.4	 They've got a 50 50 Senate and a three seat margin in the House.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3595.3s	3595.3	 LBJ, when he passed the Great Society, he had like 69 senators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3599.0s	3599.0	 He had a filibuster super majority, filibuster proof super majority in the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3603.6s	3603.6	 He had something like 150 more seat margin in the House.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3607.2s	3607.2	 That is the kind of margins you need to pass Great Society like programs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3610.4s	3610.4	 So instead of having, I'd say, ambitions that were reasonable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3614.8s	3614.8	 the administration cox is with the progressives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3617.4s	3617.4	 They come together with this for over four and a half billion of spending,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3624.2s	3624.2	 And they want it even more. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3626.0s	3626.0	 And then they've been trying to jam this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3627.8s	3627.8	 And they never went to the center of the party to cinema, to mansion and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3632.2s	3632.2	 hey, what are you guys willing to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3634.1s	3634.1	 And so somehow I think they thought they could just jam this thing through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3637.3s	3637.3	 over the objections of these votes that they absolutely need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3640.0s	3640.0	 And I think there's really this mentality on the part of the progressive left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3643.8s	3643.8	 that I think they're so used to jamming people with speech codes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3647.4s	3647.4	 and cancellation and censorship and covid mandates

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3654.6s	3654.6	 I think they're just used to jamming people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3656.6s	3656.6	 And they think they're going to shame people on Twitter like these centers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3659.7s	3659.7	 like mansion, like cinema into voting their way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3661.9s	3661.9	 Guess what? It doesn't work that way. Twitter is not the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3664.9s	3664.9	 Eric Adams showed that in New York.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3666.7s	3666.7	 He won that election. Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3668.7s	3668.7	 Dave Chappelle is Dave Chappelle has a 95 percent approval rating. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3672.8s	3672.8	 The critics hate him. The progressives hate him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3675.3s	3675.3	 Guess what? You know how many people were actually at that Dave Chappelle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3677.2s	3677.2	 protest? Like three dozen. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3680.2s	3680.2	 The progressives don't have the votes what they should have done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3682.9s	3682.9	 And by the way, their conduct through the whole thing has been insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3686.2s	3686.2	 AOC has basically been saying, if you don't give us everything we want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3689.0s	3689.0	 we're not voting for your one or two million dollar vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3691.4s	3691.4	 These guys have like Ace Jack off and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3694.8s	3694.8	 they're putting it down their head saying, hey, unless you give us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3697.3s	3697.3	 three and a half billion, we're not going to vote for one billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3699.6s	3699.6	 Really? You're going to do that? How does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3702.2s	3702.2	 We call their bluff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3703.3s	3703.3	 We know progressives will vote for every penny they can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3705.5s	3705.5	 What Biden should have done if we had a more hands on president
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3708.7s	3708.7	 who actually wanted to get things done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3710.3s	3710.3	 He and he knows this from his time in the Senate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3712.6s	3712.6	 He should have gone to those swing senators as a group and said, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3716.1s	3716.1	 what can we get done here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3717.6s	3717.6	 Not to AOC and Pelosi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3719.9s	3719.9	 They can't deliver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3720.8s	3720.8	 They can't deliver the vote.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3721.6s	3721.6	 The promise of Biden, I'll say, you know, as somebody who voted for Biden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3724.4s	3724.4	 I'm a little disappointed, was he was supposed to be moderate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3726.9s	3726.9	 and he was supposed to bring people to the center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3729.0s	3729.0	 And it doesn't feel like he's actually to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3731.3s	3731.3	 from what you asked us, what we think I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3734.0s	3734.0	 I'm not regretting because Trump had to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3736.3s	3736.3	 It was too much chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3737.4s	3737.4	 There was just too much risk having him in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3739.4s	3739.4	 So I am glad I voted for Biden, but I am unhappy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3742.3s	3742.3	 that he cannot build consensus down the middle and get the far left to just,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3747.9s	3747.9	 you know, pump the brakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3749.1s	3749.1	 I understand they have passion for certain projects,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3751.6s	3751.6	 but just get something done moderately and in a phased approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3755.3s	3755.3	 Why does this have to be so huge and confusing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3758.1s	3758.1	 Do the same three times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3760.0s	3760.0	 Sax is exposing what we may not know, which is that progressives are very loud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3766.5s	3766.5	 but they may not actually represent a plurality of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3769.7s	3769.7	 So, for example, in the Netflix protest, I saw a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3773.6s	3773.6	 and there was about two dozen people, you know, and one person actually had tweeted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3778.0s	3778.0	 Hey, I never even showed up to the office yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3780.2s	3780.2	 But now I'm showing up to walk out of the office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3783.2s	3783.2	 But then what happened was there were some other people that showed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3786.3s	3786.3	 And in the middle of the protest, they had a sign that said, you know, jokes are funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3791.0s	3791.0	 I like jokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3792.2s	3792.2	 And then everybody started chanting that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3794.0s	3794.0	 Then a black woman got up and she started to say black lives matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3798.0s	3798.0	 And then everybody got confused and started to chant black lives matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3801.3s	3801.3	 And then they were all looking around each other, trying to find direction in this protest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3805.3s	3805.3	 And it became somewhat directionless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3807.9s	3807.9	 And I think this is what, you know, we're now realizing is that, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3812.5s	3812.5	 remember what, like as managers and corporations, we've all heard this term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3815.7s	3815.7	 The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3818.0s	3818.0	 But it may actually be the case that the squeaky wheel shouldn't get the grease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3821.3s	3821.3	 because it's a head fake and we're going to get lost in misdirection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3825.1s	3825.1	 Another example of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3826.5s	3826.5	 There's a guy, Dorian Abbott, and I wanted to talk about this as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3830.4s	3830.4	 This is a guy who's an acclaimed climate professor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3834.0s	3834.0	 OK, let me just give you the whole story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3835.7s	3835.7	 I'm just going to read to you because I think it's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3838.0s	3838.0	 The first couple of paragraphs of the story from The New York Times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3841.2s	3841.2	 MIT invites geophysicist Dorian Abbott to give a prestigious public lecture this autumn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3846.9s	3846.9	 He seemed a natural choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3848.3s	3848.3	 He's a scientific star who studies climate change and whether planets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3851.7s	3851.7	 and distant solar systems might harbor atmospheres conducive to life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3855.4s	3855.4	 Then a swell of angry resistance arose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3858.1s	3858.1	 Some faculty members and grad students argue that Dr. Abbott,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3861.2s	3861.2	 who's a prophet at University of Chicago, had created harm by speaking out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3865.5s	3865.5	 against aspects of affirmative action and diversity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3868.5s	3868.5	 because in videos and opinion pieces, he wants people and members of groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3872.7s	3872.7	 rather than as individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3876.0s	3876.0	 He basically favors a diverse pool of applicants selected on merit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3880.6s	3880.6	 So but he said his planned lecture at MIT was about climate science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3884.4s	3884.4	 and to help people understand climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3887.2s	3887.2	 And would make no mention of his views on affirmative action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3890.8s	3890.8	 But his opponents argued that he was infuriating, inappropriate and oppressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3896.7s	3896.7	 And so they canceled the lecture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3899.1s	3899.1	 Now, here's the question I have here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3901.2s	3901.2	 That's another example of all of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3905.0s	3905.0	 Are we better off with, let's just say there's 100 grad students,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3909.0s	3909.0	 100 brilliant minds at MIT being pushed to think even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3915.8s	3915.8	 specifically about climate change by an expert who can do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3920.8s	3920.8	 Or are we better off finding some more middle of the road person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3924.1s	3924.1	 who may be not be as intellectually ambitious around climate change,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3928.6s	3928.6	 but has a whole bunch of other views not related to climate change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3931.3s	3931.3	 that are more palatable? And what does that do for all of us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3935.1s	3935.1	 including probably all these people who probably want a solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3938.2s	3938.2	 to climate change, but who have now held back the ability to teach these kids?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3942.2s	3942.2	 What do we do? What do we think about that kind of stuff?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3944.9s	3944.9	 And this is where, again, the squeaky wheel in this case did get the grease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3948.9s	3948.9	 But are we actually better off in this example?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3951.1s	3951.1	 Friedberg, diversity of thought drives successful outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3962.4s	3962.4	 All right. Thanks for coming in for the all in podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3965.4s	3965.4	 We're telling you shit you already know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3967.3s	3967.3	 I mean, like, what are we talking about yourself?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3969.2s	3969.2	 People listen to a bunch of opinions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3971.9s	3971.9	 And if somebody says something you don't like or challenges you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3975.1s	3975.1	 do you know who you're talking to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3976.5s	3976.5	 You learn or grow or for you to make a blog post or do your own stand up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3980.4s	3980.4	 special and give your own talk that challenges their debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3983.4s	3983.4	 like we do here every week. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3985.8s	3985.8	 You guys are more the same thing happened with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3987.7s	3987.7	 What's that ultra conservative young guy, Saks, who went to Berkeley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3991.0s	3991.0	 a few years ago and they blocked him and joined the campus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3993.6s	3993.6	 No, no, no. The Greek name Greek name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3996.6s	3996.6	 You know, Annapolis, Meelo, Annapolis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=3999.3s	3999.3	 He's the right wing guy, the gay provocateur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4001.8s	4001.8	 Here we're talking about an expert in climate change, giving a lecture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4004.8s	4004.8	 about climate change to grad students who could then go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4008.4s	4008.4	 and solve climate change for the all of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4010.9s	4010.9	 I mean, this is MIT and U.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4012.6s	4012.6	 Chicago, which are probably two of the smartest institutions of people in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4016.5s	4016.5	 Right. He's not saying anything politically offensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4018.6s	4018.6	 It's just that his unrelated views, they view they think are anathema
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4023.4s	4023.4	 and therefore they're going to protest and block him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4025.8s	4025.8	 And of course, they always use the language of safetyism, which is, oh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4029.9s	4029.9	 well, if you allow this person on campus, it threatens my safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4033.0s	4033.0	 Really? This person's a physical threat to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4035.0s	4035.0	 No, he threatens my self-conception.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4037.6s	4037.6	 Really? He said something that, you know, he's going to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4040.3s	4040.3	 something that offends you. No, it's just that, you know, he said things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4044.1s	4044.1	 that that threaten my view of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4046.1s	4046.1	 So my safety is jeopardized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4047.7s	4047.7	 I mean, this is this is literally the language that's being used now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4051.7s	4051.7	 I mean, Freiburg's reaction to it is, yeah, this is so obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4054.6s	4054.6	 that we don't even need to discuss it, but it's not so obvious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4057.9s	4057.9	 that it's not taking place. It's happening. It's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4060.4s	4060.4	 It's happening. You know what I find the most disappointing about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4063.2s	4063.2	 the whole Netflix situation is I thought Dave Chappelle, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4067.3s	4067.3	 even though maybe the special wasn't as funny as other ones,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4070.0s	4070.0	 I thought it made you think in such a just incredible way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4073.1s	4073.1	 And I was actually read that I looked up the transcript
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4075.0s	4075.0	 and I read the transcript so I could think more about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4077.5s	4077.5	 and try to form an opinion about this turf issue and trans people and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4082.5s	4082.5	 you know, people punching up, punching down and comedy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4085.2s	4085.2	 It made me think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4086.5s	4086.5	 And then the entire discussion about this is just people walking out and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4092.0s	4092.0	 no discussion about what he actually said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4094.5s	4094.5	 And that to me is just a little bit of a tell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4096.5s	4096.5	 Like if you are so upset about what he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4099.5s	4099.5	 well, where is the transcript of what he said?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4101.8s	4101.8	 Break it down sentence by sentence and tell us exactly what he got wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4105.9s	4105.9	 and why so that we can continue the discussion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4108.6s	4108.6	 The Netflix walkout and how this thing has unfolded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4112.3s	4112.3	 the reason it's so unproductive is because they're not moving the discussion forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4115.5s	4115.5	 They're not actually listening to what Chappelle said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4118.2s	4118.2	 And spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4120.4s	4120.4	 I'm going to talk a little bit about what was in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4123.1s	4123.1	 He talked about his friendship with a trans person who was a comedian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4127.1s	4127.1	 and how he and she had these incredible discussions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4130.1s	4130.1	 and learned a lot from each other and how she was dragged on Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4134.1s	4134.1	 and a lot of tragic outcomes. And I'll leave it at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4136.6s	4136.6	 But there's no discussion about his relationship with that woman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4139.8s	4139.8	 who had a tragic fate and the substance of what he said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4143.6s	4143.6	 Did you notice that, Chamath, that there's no discussion about the actual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4147.8s	4147.8	 words and points that Dave Chappelle made that shows you that this is a disingenuous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4152.3s	4152.3	 or a broken discussion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4154.3s	4154.3	 Yeah, I just I just think that the problems that we have as a society are really big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4159.5s	4159.5	 Friedrich talked about it. We have inequality problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4161.6s	4161.6	 We have climate change problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4163.6s	4163.6	 You know, we have problems of sort of like systemic health issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4168.0s	4168.0	 These are all fixable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4170.9s	4170.9	 And I think that this other stuff is getting in the way of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4175.1s	4175.1	 getting organized to solve those issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4177.4s	4177.4	 100 percent. And I think that that frustrates me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4179.8s	4179.8	 I would have really I'm not sure I agree with this guy's views on affirmative action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4184.2s	4184.2	 Let me just be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4185.7s	4185.7	 I kind of I think on the margins, affirmative action is actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4189.3s	4189.3	 it levels the playing field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4191.0s	4191.0	 And so I support it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4193.2s	4193.2	 But I also sort of the fact that if this guy is a brilliant geophysicist,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4196.9s	4196.9	 and he's already proven that I would want my kids to be taught climate science from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4201.9s	4201.9	 Sure. I don't I don't think he's out there to try to like pedal his affirmative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4205.9s	4205.9	 action views, you know, to a bunch of other physicists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4209.3s	4209.3	 I don't think that's what he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4211.3s	4211.3	 That's not what he's celebrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4212.6s	4212.6	 It's not his life's work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4213.5s	4213.5	 And so I don't care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4215.8s	4215.8	 I would want all of those really brilliant kids at MIT to have to be one step closer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4221.6s	4221.6	 to proposing a solution to climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4223.8s	4223.8	 I think that's a pervasive global issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4226.9s	4226.9	 I mean, we don't have the ability to prioritize these things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4230.7s	4230.7	 And and that's what's just so sad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4234.4s	4234.4	 We're not going to have an honest conversation about climate change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4237.0s	4237.0	 because we can't have that expert give his talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4239.2s	4239.2	 And I don't think we're to Jason's point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4240.8s	4240.8	 I don't think we're having an honest conversation about the Chappelle special.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4243.6s	4243.6	 I don't think any of us believe that Chappelle hates LGBTQ people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4247.6s	4247.6	 or I don't think anyone in the audience thinks that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4250.0s	4250.0	 And I think you have to deliberately misinterpret
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4252.9s	4252.9	 what Chappelle is thinking in or saying in order to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4256.7s	4256.7	 that his message is hate. I don't think it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4259.1s	4259.1	 Now, what I think the Chappelle special represents a threat to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4262.7s	4262.7	 is perhaps this idea of intersectionality, that all of these oppressed groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4267.0s	4267.0	 have to be on the same team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4268.7s	4268.7	 What he seems to be saying is there's a group of what he's kind of making fun of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4272.9s	4272.9	 is that there's this group of sort of pampered, rich, white
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4277.1s	4277.1	 LGBTQ people who have made enormous progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4282.1s	4282.1	 I mean, doesn't he say at one point in the special that, you know, I wish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4285.2s	4285.2	 I wish my community, you know, black people could have made as much progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4288.7s	4288.7	 in 40 years in terms of acceptance as this group has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4292.5s	4292.5	 And yet this group now wants us to immediately adopt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4296.0s	4296.0	 all of their language and sensibilities and punches down, talks down to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4301.1s	4301.1	 If we don't, I mean, that's kind of the point he's making is he's kind of revealing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4304.7s	4304.7	 a little bit of a rift between these between these two groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4308.6s	4308.6	 that are supposed to have the United.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4310.3s	4310.3	 If you saw the clip of the protest, that rift was actually in display
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4313.5s	4313.5	 because everybody got confused about what they were supposed to support,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4316.9s	4316.9	 because you had one set of chants and then you had jokes or funny chants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4322.2s	4322.2	 and then you had BLM chants from completely different cohorts of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4325.9s	4325.9	 And it just became a chaos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4327.7s	4327.7	 Well, I mean, everybody's opinion must be put through the lens of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4331.2s	4331.2	 how many oppressed groups they're from, you know, obesity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4334.7s	4334.7	 I'm black, I'm gay, I'm trans, I'm short, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4338.3s	4338.3	 I mean, how do we have how do you even navigate a discussion intelligently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4343.2s	4343.2	 If I have to say, OK, you're Sri Lankan, but you're rich,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4345.9s	4345.9	 Chamath and freeburgs, gasburgers, but he's really smart about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4349.6s	4349.6	 What I mean is like, just make your point and let's have an honest discussion about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4353.2s	4353.2	 And why are we so upset about this special when in China,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4357.7s	4357.7	 you know, we've got a million people, Uyghurs being sterilized and tortured.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4361.8s	4361.8	 And then I don't know if you saw this week, Xi Jinping is saying, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4364.5s	4364.5	 he wants to get rid of the sissy people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4367.8s	4367.8	 A sissy man in is the term he's using in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4370.9s	4370.9	 They literally want to media rules against the feminine men.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4375.1s	4375.1	 Yeah, I mean, why are we not protesting that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4378.5s	4378.5	 Well, we saw this in the Middle East as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4380.3s	4380.3	 The real threat to LGBTQ people are these authoritarian governments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4384.2s	4384.2	 that really want to oppress, you know, they want to murder people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4387.7s	4387.7	 and murder gay people. Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4389.7s	4389.7	 Yeah. I mean, Chappelle is not the threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4392.3s	4392.3	 I think I think Chappelle had to be silenced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4395.2s	4395.2	 because what he's saying is actually very heretical to the progressive left,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4400.0s	4400.0	 which is that not all of these groups are on the same page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4403.5s	4403.5	 And they again, they believe in this idea of intersectionality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4406.3s	4406.3	 that all of these groups have to basically be on the same page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4410.3s	4410.3	 And actually, the more oppressed groups that you're part of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4413.4s	4413.4	 the more elevated you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4414.7s	4414.7	 And so this idea that there could be a schism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4417.3s	4417.3	 actually is something they want to silence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4419.7s	4419.7	 Yeah. I mean, Chappelle's quote, I don't disagree with the trans movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4422.6s	4422.6	 I just agree with the way they're going about it was his kind of point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4426.8s	4426.8	 And he's saying that again, let me speak on as a as a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4430.7s	4430.7	 as a color person who grew up in a minority family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4434.3s	4434.3	 You know, I would love to tell you that my parents were super, super open minded,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4437.5s	4437.5	 but that would be a lie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4440.6s	4440.6	 And, you know, I love them to death and I think they tried their best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4443.3s	4443.3	 But, you know, they came with a ton of fucking baggage and a ton of stereotypes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4447.3s	4447.3	 And, you know, I don't think that my parents would have been the most supportive of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4452.1s	4452.1	 Other minorities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4454.4s	4454.4	 Whether it's color or sexual orientation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4456.1s	4456.1	 whatever. And it was it was a lot of like very complicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4459.2s	4459.2	 conversations to explain to them how to see the world differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4461.9s	4461.9	 And, you know, that's what happened when you pluck them out of a third world country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4465.1s	4465.1	 and drop them into Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4466.2s	4466.2	 And, you know, I think that my parents came far a very long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4470.1s	4470.1	 I remember, you know, when when I first started, you know, dating my ex wife,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4474.3s	4474.3	 it's like it was a very complicated thing for them to see me dating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4477.5s	4477.5	 an Asian woman. Very complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4479.7s	4479.7	 They didn't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4481.4s	4481.4	 And then it was like, well, do you do you want me to marry or date a Sri Lankan?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4485.2s	4485.2	 And they were like, yes, but as long as she's not Muslim.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4488.3s	4488.3	 And it's like, what the hell are you like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4489.8s	4489.8	 What are you saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4491.2s	4491.2	 And and so I'm just trying to tell you that this idea of intersectionality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4494.5s	4494.5	 it does play out in a lot of our lives because we all come from families,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4497.4s	4497.4	 especially our aging parents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4499.3s	4499.3	 Oh, my God. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4500.1s	4500.1	 Our my grandparents, there were some.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4503.3s	4503.3	 I mean, I love my parents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4504.7s	4504.7	 I'll be honest with you. They're, you know, they try their best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4507.9s	4507.9	 But man, the thing that's got me particularly saddened or tilted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4512.3s	4512.3	 or just, you know, the thing that just sort of hits me is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4516.6s	4516.6	 we've made so much progress in so many ways as a society,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4520.2s	4520.2	 yet we don't celebrate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4522.3s	4522.3	 And we seem incredibly focused on marginal issues, to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4525.1s	4525.1	 not that are not global warming, that are not education, that are that are not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4530.8s	4530.8	 you know, international
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4534.9s	4534.9	 relations and geopolitics, you know, like there's economic empowerment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4539.1s	4539.1	 There's so many things that we could be focused on that would actually make change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4542.7s	4542.7	 that arguing about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4544.6s	4544.6	 canceling Chappell and it would unite Kevin Hart on the office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4547.8s	4547.8	 But it would unite people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4549.2s	4549.2	 That's what I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4550.0s	4550.0	 So that's what I think is such a great opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4552.0s	4552.0	 If we all collectively came together and focused on a bigger enemy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4556.2s	4556.2	 Right. Climate change, climate change, governments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4558.9s	4558.9	 I think you'd find people to be much more accepting of each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4561.8s	4561.8	 because we would have a common shared goal and then we would find commonality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4565.1s	4565.1	 in achieving it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4566.8s	4566.8	 Yeah, so, J.K.L. Bill Maher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4568.7s	4568.7	 invented a word to describe what you're what you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4571.0s	4571.0	 which is progressive phobia, which is it's the reluctance to admit any progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4575.2s	4575.2	 because of the fear that if you do admit progress, then that means that you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4579.0s	4579.0	 you will lack a justification for all these progressive programs that people want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4583.1s	4583.1	 And so they have to make the situations always seem as dire as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4587.5s	4587.5	 in order to scare people into a certain agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4590.4s	4590.4	 But yeah, there's a, you know, unwillingness to admit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4593.6s	4593.6	 how much progress we've made in so many areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4595.8s	4595.8	 The time they tried to cancel me was because I said on Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4598.6s	4598.6	 isn't it amazing that every single skill you want to learn right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4602.5s	4602.5	 and including the high paying jobs is now available for free on MIT course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4606.9s	4606.9	 where anybody can learn this stuff for free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4609.2s	4609.2	 And you used to have to pay $50,000 a year and get accepted into these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4612.8s	4612.8	 you know, Ivy League programs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4614.0s	4614.0	 But now all that information is free and all we need to do is expose people to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4617.9s	4617.9	 and give them the motivation, the time to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4619.6s	4619.6	 And they were like, how could you say that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4621.3s	4621.3	 You know, people are not able to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4623.4s	4623.4	 And I was like, and then a bunch of people replied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4625.6s	4625.6	 Who were people of color or people who were poor and said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4627.9s	4627.9	 I actually learned to code on the MIT website, I learned artificial intelligence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4630.9s	4630.9	 I learned I got my degree in, you know, social media marketing or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4635.5s	4635.5	 at this website, Udemy that website, other treehouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4639.0s	4639.0	 And all these people are saying, yeah, I learned all these skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4640.6s	4640.6	 And I went from making working at Walmart to making 60k a year, 70k a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4644.0s	4644.0	 And then there was this big fight like, are you going to cancel me for saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4647.5s	4647.5	 there's more opportunity now than ever?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4649.7s	4649.7	 I hold that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4651.3s	4651.3	 There was more opportunity now for you to learn a skill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4654.4s	4654.4	 and get a high paying job than in the history of humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4657.1s	4657.1	 The system is more fair now than ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4660.0s	4660.0	 Yeah, I was going to say, are you with that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4661.9s	4661.9	 In the in the world of in the world of progress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4664.9s	4664.9	 there are some amazing innovations every day this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4667.9s	4667.9	 And I put this in the chat and Nick, you can post the article.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4671.1s	4671.1	 There was a gentleman in at the NYC and NYU Langone Center of Medicine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4677.7s	4677.7	 Who transplanted a pig kidney
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4681.9s	4681.9	 into a human and had that human kidney or basically had that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4687.0s	4687.0	 pig kidney not get rejected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4689.1s	4689.1	 Now, this was a person that was brain dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4690.9s	4690.9	 And I guess, you know, the family, you know, God bless them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4694.1s	4694.1	 Oh, donated this person's body to science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4697.4s	4697.4	 Effectively, they were kept alive, but then they were able to transplant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4700.4s	4700.4	 the kidney in and they were able to see the urine production and creatinine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4703.9s	4703.9	 production. And all of a sudden now, there is a chance that we could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4707.7s	4707.7	 actually use pigs, genetically engineered pigs as a basis for us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4713.3s	4713.3	 to basically get kidneys, hearts, lungs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4716.9s	4716.9	 That is incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4718.7s	4718.7	 Freeburg. So to your point, Saks, that is happening still every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4722.6s	4722.6	 And we don't talk up enough about it because we're up in arms about Dave Chappelle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4726.3s	4726.3	 Freeburg, tell us, you know, if that in 10 years, what that looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4730.8s	4730.8	 and in the impact it has in society, if we take that pig transplant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4734.1s	4734.1	 and we just 10 exit from now, put a couple of billion dollars behind it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4737.1s	4737.1	 What does it look like in a decade?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4738.6s	4738.6	 Well, I think there's other techniques that are being developed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4741.8s	4741.8	 that you could actually generate actual human organs using,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4747.2s	4747.2	 you know, basis of induced these induced pluripotent stem cells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4752.3s	4752.3	 And regardless of the path, I do think like availability of organ transplants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4759.0s	4759.0	 is going to go up like crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4762.1s	4762.1	 The big infrastructure and technical challenge we still face is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4766.8s	4766.8	 we've got to build these these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4768.7s	4768.7	 GMP facilities to make all of these cell based therapies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4773.5s	4773.5	 not just kind of organs, but also other cell based therapies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4776.4s	4776.4	 that are becoming kind of the mainstay of the future of medicine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4779.8s	4779.8	 personalized medicine for humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4782.7s	4782.7	 And so there's also this kind of tremendous infrastructure opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4786.1s	4786.1	 We've talked a lot about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4788.0s	4788.0	 we've talked a lot about infrastructure in bio manufacturing broadly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4791.8s	4791.8	 and other life sciences opportunities, but there's a tremendous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4794.3s	4794.3	 infrastructure opportunity to build out facilities that can produce these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4799.3s	4799.3	 you know, these these therapies and the therapy can be an organ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4802.2s	4802.2	 or a cell based therapy that can target cancer in your body or what have you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4807.2s	4807.2	 And so you can kind of think about, look, we've resolved the science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4810.4s	4810.4	 Now we've also resolved the engineering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4812.7s	4812.7	 The next step is to build it. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4815.5s	4815.5	 And so this is like, you know, the bill decade, the bill decades
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4819.9s	4819.9	 globally for where the intersection of software and biology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4823.6s	4823.6	 has enabled these incredible breakthroughs in human health
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4826.1s	4826.1	 and manufacturing and food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4828.4s	4828.4	 And now the infrastructure needs are there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4830.3s	4830.3	 I've said this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4831.5s	4831.5	 I do think this is where we are have the biggest gap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4834.6s	4834.6	 in terms of infrastructure needs and the biggest opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4837.4s	4837.4	 to kind of fill those needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4838.4s	4838.4	 And if we if I were to kind of be in Congress or be president,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4841.7s	4841.7	 I would say this is the number one priority for an infrastructure bill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4845.5s	4845.5	 Because once you get this going, it's going to change lives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4847.5s	4847.5	 and it's going to change the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4849.4s	4849.4	 So high speed rail costing us 50 billion, 100 billion versus this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4854.5s	4854.5	 Yeah, yeah, we could build a bunch of gyms or a bunch of bio manufacturing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4858.2s	4858.2	 facilities, a lot of stuff that we could build that would,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4861.5s	4861.5	 you know, pay back within years and have a huge outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4865.1s	4865.1	 Private markets maybe will meet this demand, but I think you got to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4868.5s	4868.5	 you got to kickstart this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4870.1s	4870.1	 The economics are going to be unfeasible for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4872.5s	4872.5	 If you want to get a car teeth therapy, which is a type of therapy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4875.9s	4875.9	 that's personal, you know, personalized party therapies today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4879.1s	4879.1	 your cost is about four hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4882.9s	4882.9	 You know, a local university here, I was speaking with one of their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4886.6s	4886.6	 their lead doctors the other day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4889.9s	4889.9	 They've built their own GMP facility at a cost of fifty million dollars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4893.0s	4893.0	 and they can now get the therapies down to forty thousand dollars per patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4896.4s	4896.4	 But they can only serve two hundred and fifty patients a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4900.1s	4900.1	 Using that that kind of 90 percent cost reduction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4902.8s	4902.8	 So you can kind of see like as you build these systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4905.2s	4905.2	 and this is built locally by a university, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4908.0s	4908.0	 It's not built for industrial scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4909.4s	4909.4	 These guys aren't commercial operators of these facilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4912.0s	4912.0	 So if you start to build these facilities from a commercial point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4915.0s	4915.0	 and you can bootstrap some of these things and this infrastructure cost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4918.6s	4918.6	 very quickly, the cost becomes so low that you see these technologies proliferate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4923.6s	4923.6	 And I think we should see that both, you know, this organ transplant one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4926.7s	4926.7	 is a great case study, cell based therapies, biomanufacturing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4930.9s	4930.9	 all sorts of opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4932.9s	4932.9	 You keep saying GMP facility. Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4935.3s	4935.3	 Good manufacturing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4936.7s	4936.7	 Yeah, it's you know, if you're going to make cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4940.1s	4940.1	 that are going to go in your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4941.9s	4941.9	 there's incredibly stringent requirements on the safety and the cleanliness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4944.9s	4944.9	 and the practices that go on in that facility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4946.8s	4946.8	 So these quote unquote GMP facilities have a very specific criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4951.1s	4951.1	 of how you how you build and how you operate them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4953.0s	4953.0	 They're just highly they're high quality facilities is what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4956.3s	4956.3	 Yeah. Think about like a clean room to make semiconductors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4958.5s	4958.5	 except in this case, you're making cells that you're putting in your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4960.8s	4960.8	 So you got to be really careful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4963.0s	4963.0	 All right, everybody. It's been 70 minutes, 75 minutes, 80 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4966.5s	4966.5	 Anybody have any last minute plugs for products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4969.8s	4969.8	 that they want to disguise as a compliment to another best thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4973.8s	4973.8	 I still think we should launch bestie coin, the all in coin and monetize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4977.3s	4977.3	 the all in podcast. We were talking about this at poker last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4979.6s	4979.6	 Monetization, no more than NFTs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4982.0s	4982.0	 And we have to ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4983.5s	4983.5	 No, besty besty coin would be incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4986.1s	4986.1	 I think I want to tell you about this guy, Lee Jackie,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4989.4s	4989.4	 who's known as the lipstick king in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4993.0s	4993.0	 He did a 12 hour live stream on Wednesday on Taobao.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4996.5s	4996.5	 250 million people tuned in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGenTdTrYEo&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=83&t=4999.1s	4999.1	 He sold one point seven billion dollars a product.
