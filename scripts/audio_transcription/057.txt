https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=418.6s	418.6	 streak and the hand came along where the dealer had like a five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=422.8s	422.8	 showing and I basically I doubled down for my last, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=426.4s	426.4	 know, last bets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=428.5s	428.5	 And then the dealer like misstealed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=431.0s	431.0	 She like did the cards out of order and Phil made her rewind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=434.3s	434.3	 the cards and have them go back to where they were supposed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=436.7s	436.7	 go instead of declaring the hand of misdeal because I had like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=440.5s	440.5	 So anyway, the pit boss came over, they ended up listening to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=505.7s	505.7	 week off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=506.0s	506.0	 We regret it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=507.9s	507.9	 Couple of things have happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=508.8s	508.8	 I don't know if you guys look at the stats, but we, I, I couldn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=511.8s	511.8	 believe it, but we were the 41st most popular episode two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=515.0s	515.0	 episodes ago in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=517.5s	517.5	 So the pod has reached some sort of tipping point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=519.7s	519.7	 I don't know if you're having this experience in Miami, David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=521.6s	521.6	 but is everybody stopping you to say they love all in and did you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=524.4s	524.4	 see all the Spotify love of people who watched like 3000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=528.2s	528.2	 minutes of all in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=529.6s	529.6	 that was a viral feature that Spotify came up with was a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=533.2s	533.2	 to basically it generates a list of what your top shows were for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=538.2s	538.2	 the year based on listening minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=539.7s	539.7	 So they it's like actually mathematical and then you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=542.8s	542.8	 basically retweet that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=543.8s	543.8	 So yeah, I've seen a lot of tweets of people saying that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=545.9s	545.9	 were number one or top five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=547.5s	547.5	 I had one guy stopped me at our Basel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=549.1s	549.1	 I don't get stopped that much, but there is a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=551.4s	551.4	 of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=552.2s	552.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=552.3s	552.3	 I'm going to stop constantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=553.3s	553.3	 And it was just a flood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=554.4s	554.4	 So thank you to everybody who shared that and for tuning in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=556.6s	556.6	 we're, we apologize for taking weeks off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=558.2s	558.2	 We're going to have a no weeks off rule going forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=560.2s	560.2	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=560.5s	560.5	 That's something absolutely necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=562.1s	562.1	 But last week we had a new variant come out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=567.8s	567.8	 We've been talking about it a whole bunch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=569.8s	569.8	 We didn't talk about Miami.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=570.9s	570.9	 How was Miami?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=572.4s	572.4	 You've been having a good time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=573.4s	573.4	 Well, I got to, I got to tell a story about Miami.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=575.6s	575.6	 So, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=576.6s	576.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=576.9s	576.9	 So, I mean, I think this place is paradise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=579.2s	579.2	 You know, first of all, the weather is just perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=581.4s	581.4	 This time of year, San Francisco was miserable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=583.2s	583.2	 It was like rainy and cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=584.6s	584.6	 Do we come here and it's like mid seventies all week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=587.1s	587.1	 And of course you're not stepping over hypodermic needles or feces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=590.2s	590.2	 or you're not worried about being randomly assaulted by a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=593.2s	593.2	 homeless drug addict, having a psychotic break just for starters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=596.6s	596.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=597.5s	597.5	 So, you know, we've been like talking all week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=600.5s	600.5	 We've been talking all week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=601.5s	601.5	 That's just in your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=602.8s	602.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=606.1s	606.1	 That's just in the mausoleum before you get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=608.0s	608.0	 That's just going to Starbucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=609.2s	609.2	 Yeah, that's just going to Starbucks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=610.4s	610.4	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=611.2s	611.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=611.6s	611.6	 So in any event, we're having this conversation about, should we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=614.1s	614.1	 just move here full time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=615.3s	615.3	 And you know, it's like, it's, you know, it's a heart wrenching or gut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=619.4s	619.4	 wrenching decision because the kids have schools and friends and we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=622.2s	622.2	 been in California a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=623.5s	623.5	 And so here we are wringing our hands about whether to make this move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=626.8s	626.8	 And all of a sudden I read online that Nancy Pelosi just spent 25 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=632.9s	632.9	 buying her retirement house for when she loses the house in 2022, presumably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=637.5s	637.5	 she'll retire as speaker, you know, in January 23, when she's not speaker anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=641.8s	641.8	 She's going to move, she's going to move to Santa Barbara.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=644.4s	644.4	 So she's moving to Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=645.4s	645.4	 She bought a place in, in Jupiter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=646.6s	646.6	 It wasn't true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=648.3s	648.3	 It was, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=649.0s	649.0	 I know, I know it turned out to be fake news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=650.8s	650.8	 Well, I questioned that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=651.8s	651.8	 I think it was true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=652.6s	652.6	 And then she didn't like the bad press.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=654.2s	654.2	 So they bailed out of that deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=656.1s	656.1	 Well, we won't really know what's true until January of 2023, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=659.3s	659.3	 we see where she retires to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=660.9s	660.9	 But in any event, so I'm reading this article and it says she's buying a house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=665.9s	665.9	 It's where Tiger Woods lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=667.5s	667.5	 And actually it's like half an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=669.2s	669.2	 It's half an hour from where Donald Trump is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=671.3s	671.3	 So here she is buying this house, probably with ill-gotten insider trading profits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=676.7s	676.7	 And she's going to live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=679.0s	679.0	 She's the best trader in the center.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=680.9s	680.9	 Unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=681.4s	681.4	 In the world, in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=683.4s	683.4	 All of our government officials, she's got the best inside information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=686.4s	686.4	 And she's planning to retire to a community of people she's demonized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=690.4s	690.4	 I mean, starting with like Trump and then Tiger Woods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=693.3s	693.3	 And so she's going to be living in this community of people who she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=696.3s	696.3	 been moralizing against and demonizing against as the speaker of the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=700.1s	700.1	 And meanwhile, the rest of us are wringing our hands about whether we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=702.4s	702.4	 should stay in San Francisco, the city, the dystopian city that she's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=706.4s	706.4	 political boss of, that her political machine has run into the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=709.9s	709.9	 And I'm looking at this going like, oh, no, you don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=712.4s	712.4	 You're not leaving me holding the bag for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=716.0s	716.0	 If you're, if you're going to Florida, you can turn the lights out, Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=721.1s	721.1	 Leave me holding the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=722.3s	722.3	 I'm like the last one in San Francisco.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=723.7s	723.7	 I'm returning out the lights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=725.2s	725.2	 So did that tip the scale for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=727.4s	727.4	 I'm like, I'm definitely out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=729.0s	729.0	 I'm like, if the boss of San Francisco is out of here, I'm definitely out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=732.7s	732.7	 But I have some people, some other people to convince.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=735.2s	735.2	 In fairness to Nancy Pelosi, she's sitting on a ton of equities and she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=739.2s	739.2	 doesn't want to pay cap gains in California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=742.3s	742.3	 You got to be fair to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=743.3s	743.3	 It's not like she wants to pay for the ridiculous spending in California
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=747.0s	747.0	 when she does, you know, cash out all those chips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=750.5s	750.5	 I guess, Freberg, let's go to you to talk about the new variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=753.1s	753.1	 Maybe you could tell us how to pronounce it, because there seems to be some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=755.8s	755.8	 debate about the pronunciation of this and what's your take on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=760.4s	760.4	 Were you in a frat in college?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=762.4s	762.4	 You have to memorize the Greek alphabet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=763.8s	763.8	 I went to school at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=765.6s	765.6	 So I didn't write the college experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=767.2s	767.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=767.8s	767.8	 I went to high school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=768.3s	768.3	 I think it's Omicron, but that's the...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=772.0s	772.0	 Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=773.6s	773.6	 Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=775.5s	775.5	 And it's...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=776.2s	776.2	 Try it again, J Cal, one last time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=778.3s	778.3	 Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=782.0s	782.0	 There's no N.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=783.5s	783.5	 Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=784.5s	784.5	 Let's unitize the Greek alphabet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=787.0s	787.0	 Megatron?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=788.1s	788.1	 It's not a transformer, J Cal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=789.4s	789.4	 Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=790.1s	790.1	 Omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=791.3s	791.3	 I missed you, Sax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=792.8s	792.8	 Wait, how many miles away from here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=794.6s	794.6	 Let's go get a Cuban sandwich after this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=796.8s	796.8	 Yeah, come over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=797.6s	797.6	 Why aren't you guys together right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=798.8s	798.8	 I don't get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=799.4s	799.4	 I thought you guys would be in the same room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=800.6s	800.6	 Let's go to the Cuban deli and play, I don't know, Cuban sandwich chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=805.2s	805.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=806.2s	806.2	 Who could eat less bites and lose our weight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=809.8s	809.8	 I have the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=810.5s	810.5	 I got the sandwich place over in Little Havana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=812.2s	812.2	 That's unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=813.2s	813.2	 But anyway, continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=814.3s	814.3	 Tell us if it's the end of the world or no worry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=816.7s	816.7	 No, I mean, at this point, there's three things that scientists are looking out for data on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=822.7s	822.7	 One is kind of the innate transmissibility of this variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=828.1s	828.1	 Which is like the R0 in an unvaccinated population.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=831.2s	831.2	 The second is immune evasion, meaning it can get around antibodies or get around people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=835.7s	835.7	 that are vaccinated or have had the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=838.4s	838.4	 And then third is kind of the severity, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=841.1s	841.1	 Which is like how many people translate into hospitalized cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=845.4s	845.4	 Every day, there's varying data and information coming out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=848.8s	848.8	 There's an incredible spike in South African surveillance data and testing data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=854.4s	854.4	 Right now, as of today, I think 25% of people getting tested in South Africa are testing positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=860.5s	860.5	 Wow, that's stunning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=863.0s	863.0	 Only about a quarter of the population is vaccinated there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=867.0s	867.0	 This will be pretty telling pretty quickly on if hospitalizations start to climb and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=871.9s	871.9	 if the disease severity in an unvaccinated population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=876.0s	876.0	 matches or mimics what we've seen with other variants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=878.3s	878.3	 This variant is quite different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=879.7s	879.7	 There's like 30 mutations on the spike protein here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=883.5s	883.5	 Normally, you'll see an evolution where one mutation leads to another variant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=887.2s	887.2	 leads to another variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=888.2s	888.2	 They call it a new variant when there's enough kind of differential behavior of the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=892.6s	892.6	 So there's always mutations happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=894.0s	894.0	 But once a mutation causes a change in behavior, they know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=897.4s	897.4	 Normally, you see kind of an evolutionary track where there's like one mutation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=899.8s	899.8	 then another, then another, and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=901.8s	901.8	 In this case, this mutation set is so far away from anything else that exists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=907.4s	907.4	 There's like 30 new mutations that popped up on this protein,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=910.9s	910.9	 on this sequence that sequences for this protein, that it's like such a different virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=916.6s	916.6	 This is a major upgrade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=918.1s	918.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=919.2s	919.2	 It's so different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=920.1s	920.1	 It's almost like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=921.1s	921.1	 It's like a new virus altogether.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=922.6s	922.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=922.7s	922.7	 It's almost like it's not a naturally occurring virus that behaves like other viruses do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=927.3s	927.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=927.5s	927.5	 So cutting the conspiracy...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=929.2s	929.2	 When did China upgrade the virus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=932.2s	932.2	 Let me cut the conspiracy theory for a second and just say what the kind of current consensus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=937.6s	937.6	 thinking is of what may have caused this incredible change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=941.3s	941.3	 One is that someone or some people that have severe immune compromised systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=947.1s	947.1	 had a virus in them that did not kill them, but just kept circulating in their bodies for months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=951.7s	951.7	 and months and months and mutated so much that it got to the point, and this is what's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=955.5s	955.5	 interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=956.4s	956.4	 It got to the point that it mutated such that it can now transmit amongst a vaccinated population.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=961.8s	961.8	 So think about the virus finally found a way out of the floodgates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=964.8s	964.8	 and the floodgates are blocked in by vaccinated people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=968.4s	968.4	 That's one reasonable explanation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=970.3s	970.3	 The other one is that South Africa is just a monitoring station.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=973.5s	973.5	 There's a whole big chunk of Africa where we have no surveillance going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=976.9s	976.9	 There's no genetic sequencing going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=979.4s	979.4	 There could have been anywhere in Southern Africa or even in Central Africa that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=982.8s	982.8	 viruses could have been circulating amongst populations for the last year and a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=986.4s	986.4	 with no surveillance or testing or sequencing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=988.9s	988.9	 All of a sudden, one person travels to South Africa and boom, this thing pops up on the radar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=992.6s	992.6	 and everyone's like, oh, wow, look at what we just stumbled into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=996.9s	996.9	 Look, one thing that seems pretty certain, this variant is going to be everywhere fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1001.7s	1001.7	 It is so transmissible by some estimates, and you can read Trevor Bedford or there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1007.5s	1007.5	 a bunch of great folks on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1008.8s	1008.8	 You can follow their writings on this, but Trevor's done a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1012.4s	1012.4	 The R0 on this could be as high as 40, which is measles by comparison is 12 to 13.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1019.6s	1019.6	 Now, it's more likely that the R0 is somewhere between 7 and 20,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1023.8s	1023.8	 but regardless, it seems to be that high in the presence of an immunized population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1030.7s	1030.7	 meaning it's got incredibly good evasiveness around people that have the vaccine or have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1036.9s	1036.9	 had the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1037.9s	1037.9	 It's going to spread like crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1039.3s	1039.3	 I think this whole thing is a complete fucking nothing burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1042.3s	1042.3	 Yeah, and so that's the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1043.7s	1043.7	 It's like maybe it's just not a big deal and it ends up being like delta and it sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1047.4s	1047.4	 spreads around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1047.9s	1047.9	 A lot of people don't know they have it and then all of a sudden, we all wake up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1051.5s	1051.5	 It's even more impotent than Delta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1053.7s	1053.7	 So that is definitely something that people are saying because there's not a lot of new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1057.7s	1057.7	 hospitalizations spiking in South Africa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1059.8s	1059.8	 We're not seeing severe cases of all these people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1062.1s	1062.1	 25% of people are testing positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1064.1s	1064.1	 They're showing mild to no symptoms and that's anecdotal right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1067.2s	1067.2	 So we'll know in the next two weeks of whether this actually changes hospitalization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1070.5s	1070.5	 To me, this is more of an example of yet again, how unreliable our institutions are than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1077.2s	1077.2	 anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1078.7s	1078.7	 We knew nothing about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1080.7s	1080.7	 We had a couple of cases and the mainstream media literally in a moment where there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1087.7s	1087.7	 frankly not a lot of news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1089.6s	1089.6	 Slowest news of the year is the day after Thanksgiving for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1092.6s	1092.6	 This is when it broke Friday after Thanksgiving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1094.2s	1094.2	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1094.8s	1094.8	 Essentially manufactured this histrionic reaction to something where we didn't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1100.8s	1100.8	 anything about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1101.7s	1101.7	 We didn't know how important it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1104.3s	1104.3	 We didn't know how bad it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1105.8s	1105.8	 We didn't know anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1107.9s	1107.9	 And then what happened was then the financial media took that and then ran with it basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1112.2s	1112.2	 trying to whip up even more histrionics but within the financial markets which then feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1117.2s	1117.2	 the mainstream news cycle and we had this whole loop going down the toilet bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1122.5s	1122.5	 And lo and behold, I think what we're actually learning is what we should have just waited a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1126.9s	1126.9	 few days to realize beforehand, which is it's not that severe, but to the extent that it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1132.4s	1132.4	 we've sequenced it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1133.6s	1133.6	 We have vaccines and we can deploy these quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1136.4s	1136.4	 Oh, by the way, at the same time, the New England Journal of Messon put out this study,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1141.4s	1141.4	 which basically showed how important and efficacious these vaccines are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1144.6s	1144.6	 So the fact that we're even talking about this to me is just absolutely emotional and not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1152.0s	1152.0	 practical or useful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1153.8s	1153.8	 The big question, Chamath, is it's not about whether it is functionally a nothing burger or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1159.7s	1159.7	 not, but what's really important now is how policymakers are going to respond to this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1164.6s	1164.6	 because there is a press cycle, there is a bit of a hysteria, everyone's asking me about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1168.9s	1168.9	 everyone's freaked out about it, everyone's worrying about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1171.7s	1171.7	 And so the policymakers are going to respond to that sentiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1174.8s	1174.8	 And the question is, are we about to face more lockdowns and things that are going to be adverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1179.4s	1179.4	 to the economy and how are markets going to react?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1182.2s	1182.2	 Not necessarily to the true severity and the risk of this variant, but more importantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1186.9s	1186.9	 to the policy decisions that are going to come out of the perceived risk of this variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1191.1s	1191.1	 And that seems pretty scary right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1193.5s	1193.5	 Well, you saw Biden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1195.6s	1195.6	 One thing I'll give him is this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1198.0s	1198.0	 I think he's done a bad job on a lot of other things, but on this his political instincts were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1201.8s	1201.8	 sound, which is he said very clearly, we're not going to go back to lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1205.6s	1205.6	 And I think he was really speaking to Democratic governors when he said that, people like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1210.8s	1210.8	 Avinusam and our poker friend, JB Pritzker and Whitmer in Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1216.2s	1216.2	 Listen, guys, we're not going back to lockdowns no matter what happens with this Omicron thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1220.2s	1220.2	 We're not going to do school closures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1221.4s	1221.4	 We've seen how unpopular the school closures were in this off-year election.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1225.4s	1225.4	 It was one of the big issues that helped Glenn Youngkin win Virginia, which had previously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1230.9s	1230.9	 voted for Biden by 10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1232.5s	1232.5	 So I think you saw the message come down from on high, we're not going to go back to lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1237.3s	1237.3	 Now, I think though that what that does is admit, and I think what Omicron will show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1243.0s	1243.0	 is that lockdowns didn't work at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1244.8s	1244.8	 At most, lockdowns and all these measures, whether it's mass mandates or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1250.2s	1250.2	 all it did was delay the timing of the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1252.8s	1252.8	 What you're going to see is Omicron will be everywhere very soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1255.8s	1255.8	 There's nothing that policymakers can do to stop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1258.2s	1258.2	 The only thing that seems to work is vaccines and booster shots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1262.2s	1262.2	 There's some good data around the third booster preventing serious cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1267.7s	1267.7	 Other than vaccines, and I guess the one thing policymakers could do would be to get red tape
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1272.1s	1272.1	 out of the way so that they can more quickly come out with a booster to this new variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1277.3s	1277.3	 That would be the one thing they could really help with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1279.2s	1279.2	 But otherwise, nothing policymakers have done has helped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1282.2s	1282.2	 I think this is going to be an admission that ultimately lockdowns were a disaster for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1287.0s	1287.0	 economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1288.6s	1288.6	 Nobody could argue lockdowns are not a disaster for the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1291.0s	1291.0	 But in the early days, if we go back to when this pandemic started, we really didn't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1298.0s	1298.0	 how to handle this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1299.0s	1299.0	 We did not have any treatments and we were ventilating people and essentially killing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1302.7s	1302.7	 them by blowing oxygen into their lungs too aggressively, from what I understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1306.9s	1306.9	 That's a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1309.5s	1309.5	 Okay, well, I think it's a debate because we're not ventilating people now as much as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1312.8s	1312.8	 we were, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1313.2s	1313.2	 We're flipping them over, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1314.2s	1314.2	 But the lockdowns did, correct me if I'm wrong, Friedberg, at least allow us to not have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1320.6s	1320.6	 hospitals overrun like they were in New York and Italy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1322.9s	1322.9	 And that was...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1324.1s	1324.1	 I don't know if that's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1325.0s	1325.0	 I honestly don't know if the lockdowns actually changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1329.8s	1329.8	 We don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1331.3s	1331.3	 Look, I'm going to sound like some...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1332.7s	1332.7	 And now we're going to enter into this controversial territory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1336.2s	1336.2	 Sure, let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1337.8s	1337.8	 It seems like a lot of people still got together in private settings and the virus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1342.6s	1342.6	 continued to spread.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1343.8s	1343.8	 And so there's a question around how effective lockdowns were and how much they really did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1348.2s	1348.2	 change the trajectory of the spread of the virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1350.7s	1350.7	 And yes, they probably did have a muting effect, but it's unclear what the trade-off was and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1357.8s	1357.8	 whether it was really worthwhile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1359.0s	1359.0	 And at the end of the day, a few days and a few weeks after they started, people were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1362.4s	1362.4	 over them and they started meeting on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1363.9s	1363.9	 We didn't know how deadly it was though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1365.6s	1365.6	 At that time, we didn't know how deadly it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1367.0s	1367.0	 Admittedly, we didn't know a lot at the beginning of the pandemic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1369.4s	1369.4	 And so you have to, I think, give people a break for the mistakes that were made, say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1373.5s	1373.5	 in March or April.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1374.9s	1374.9	 I think by May, it was pretty clear the lockdowns weren't going to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1377.6s	1377.6	 If they had worked, states like California wouldn't have had 10 pages of exceptions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1382.2s	1382.2	 based on how politically connected you were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1384.0s	1384.0	 So for example, the local bartender had her bar run out of business by lockdowns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1388.6s	1388.6	 but Hollywood Studios would get a break on their productions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1392.6s	1392.6	 So we know that lockdowns didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1394.2s	1394.2	 Otherwise, there wouldn't have been these exceptions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1395.6s	1395.6	 And we have data from Sweden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1397.0s	1397.0	 Remember all the hysteria about Sweden basically was doing nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1401.3s	1401.3	 They weren't doing lockdowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1402.3s	1402.3	 They weren't doing mandates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1403.2s	1403.2	 They were going for herd immunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1404.3s	1404.3	 They were going for herd immunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1405.4s	1405.4	 And they were killing their people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1408.4s	1408.4	 Well, guess what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1409.0s	1409.0	 Sweden's data was no worse than anybody else's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1411.3s	1411.3	 The hospitals weren't overrun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1412.8s	1412.8	 And I think what Omicron will finally show is that our whole policy since the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1418.1s	1418.1	 of COVID, whether it was two weeks to stop the spread or these vaccine mandates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1422.3s	1422.3	 or even this idea of herd immunity, it's all been to try and put the genie back in the bottle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1426.6s	1426.6	 In other words, it's been to try and defeat COVID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1429.2s	1429.2	 It's to put this virus back in the lab, I guess you could say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1432.6s	1432.6	 And the reality is we're never going to defeat it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1434.8s	1434.8	 I mean, it really is something that we're going to have to learn to live with and to manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1439.4s	1439.4	 And so, you know, vaccine will be a variant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1442.6s	1442.6	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1443.8s	1443.8	 It'll be a seasonal disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1445.4s	1445.4	 And it'll be something like the flu in terms of how it cycles each year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1450.6s	1450.6	 And it seems unlikely that it's going to be eradicated through vaccination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1453.6s	1453.6	 Let me pull Chamath back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1455.0s	1455.0	 There may be a variant that matters, but this is not it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1459.7s	1459.7	 And instead, what we really need to do is have a process of not overreacting because there's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1465.8s	1465.8	 to be n number of these into the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1469.0s	1469.0	 And the only thing that really decays the vaccine's potency or sorry, the COVID's potency is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1478.7s	1478.7	 having it go through vaccinated people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1480.9s	1480.9	 And thank God we had so many people vaccinated because this is what we're...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1485.4s	1485.4	 So again, this whole thing is a nothing burger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1487.9s	1487.9	 Let's just move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1489.0s	1489.0	 It's stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1489.8s	1489.8	 Well, so the markets are obviously reacting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1492.2s	1492.2	 Maybe we should talk about the markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1492.8s	1492.8	 They're not reacting to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1494.0s	1494.0	 I think that they are...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1495.3s	1495.3	 You think it's an excuse?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1496.4s	1496.4	 Like people wanted to trim positions and this is a great excuse?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1499.4s	1499.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1500.1s	1500.1	 Look at...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1500.5s	1500.5	 Look, the week before when I started to trim, it was like, oh, how dare you, blah, blah, blah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1505.4s	1505.4	 You know, and I'm like, well, I don't know if the smartest people are selling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1507.8s	1507.8	 Maybe it makes sense to sell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1510.5s	1510.5	 So I started to trim and I'm so glad that I did because it was 10 days ahead or a week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1515.4s	1515.4	 ahead of all of this craziness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1516.7s	1516.7	 Now look at what's happening in the markets today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1519.1s	1519.1	 People are going massively risk off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1521.4s	1521.4	 There are almost 500 stocks that are off 30 or 40% in the last 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1526.2s	1526.2	 But the stock market is still basically at all time highs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1529.0s	1529.0	 So think of that for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1530.2s	1530.2	 So everybody that thinks that the stock market is doing poorly is wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1534.6s	1534.6	 It is doing exceptionally well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1536.8s	1536.8	 It's just that the 400 stocks that people in Silicon Valley really care about have been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1540.4s	1540.4	 getting kicked in the teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1542.7s	1542.7	 And the paper company and the specialty chemicals company have actually done reasonably well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1549.6s	1549.6	 which are not the arts, which is nothing that any of us have exposure to or, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1553.8s	1553.8	 some of us don't have exposure to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1555.0s	1555.0	 So go ahead, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1556.3s	1556.3	 Can we then look at this as, hey, the era of we're going to give a lot of credit to companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1564.5s	1564.5	 for, you know, what's going to happen in the next 10 years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1567.1s	1567.1	 10 year outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1568.1s	1568.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1568.3s	1568.3	 10 year outcome that we saw Rivian came up, you know, and then many other stocks and obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1574.1s	1574.1	 crypto falls into this, this idea of giving people a decade of forward looking credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1578.1s	1578.1	 maybe is going to come back to wavy and look at earnings or maybe two years of credit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1583.5s	1583.5	 No, I'm not going to say that because I think it's too early for us to sort of go and jump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1588.6s	1588.6	 to these conclusions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1589.7s	1589.7	 Right now, we are in a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1591.5s	1591.5	 There have been 71 or two of these moments since 2009, where you have either a sector drawdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1601.4s	1601.4	 or a market drawdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1602.9s	1602.9	 In this case, we're in the middle of a massive growth sector drawdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1607.1s	1607.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1607.4s	1607.4	 The multiples on these companies are shrinking companies like Snowflake and Peloton,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1615.7s	1615.7	 sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1615.9s	1615.9	 Cloudflare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1616.8s	1616.8	 Zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1617.2s	1617.2	 We're trading at 70 to 100 times revenue and people are reevaluating whether those multiples
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1622.5s	1622.5	 are worth it, irrespective of the quality of the company, because those are very high quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1627.4s	1627.4	 companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1627.9s	1627.9	 So we're just re-rating the risk right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1630.7s	1630.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1631.1s	1631.1	 And it's not broad based.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1632.8s	1632.8	 The real problem is all these companies that I think raised a lot of money in private markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1639.4s	1639.4	 are now going to get stuck because if the public markets have compressed multiples by 30 to 50%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1644.9s	1644.9	 they are the ultimate buyer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1647.7s	1647.7	 The idea that you can wait and then go public later may not stand to reason, especially if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1652.7s	1652.7	 inflation really keeps these multiples in check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1656.6s	1656.6	 And so all these private businesses and then all of the ones that sort of were planning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1661.3s	1661.3	 IPOs in the next 12 to 18 months are probably in a little bit more of a challenging spot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1667.8s	1667.8	 than they were before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1668.4s	1668.4	 And we're seeing a lot of, I mean, Chamath, is it not true that we're seeing a bunch of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1672.6s	1672.6	 these SPAC deals and new issuances come out to market with converts attached to them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1678.2s	1678.2	 So rather than getting a straight valuation and common equity rolled, these deals are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1683.0s	1683.0	 coming out where investors are saying, look, I'll value this thing, but I want to get paid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1686.4s	1686.4	 a preferred return and I want to have some seniority over the common.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1689.9s	1689.9	 And so I can protect my investment to some degree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1692.7s	1692.7	 At least that's what I'm hearing from bankers is kind of the rumbling in the SPAC and pipe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1697.8s	1697.8	 market right now is these kind of protective new types of equities that are coming out in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1702.1s	1702.1	 order that the investors can kind of keep their mark on their private valuation rounds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1707.0s	1707.0	 but get the company out to public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1708.5s	1708.5	 But the public market is getting a better deal than just straight common equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1713.1s	1713.1	 Look, it's like bringing Pepto Bismol to Mexico.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1715.8s	1715.8	 If you're worried about an upset stomach, don't go to Mexico.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1719.3s	1719.3	 Okay. And we just lost 7% of the audience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1722.8s	1722.8	 But you're saying you wouldn't invest in these converts for these kind of companies that need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1726.7s	1726.7	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1728.6s	1728.6	 You're you're you're we're focusing too much on the symptomology and not the root cause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1732.6s	1732.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1733.1s	1733.1	 The minute that you're trying to wrap all these features around something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1737.0s	1737.0	 you know, the nature of those kinds of features is that it's trying to subsidize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1742.6s	1742.6	 what is otherwise not a clear, simple, buyable story at that price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1746.7s	1746.7	 So either change the price or change the company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1751.0s	1751.0	 Yeah, I will say one important point about what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1753.8s	1753.8	 A lot of people have said this is a crash and that term has been used a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1757.3s	1757.3	 But, you know, because people that have only traded in markets and have a brief history,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1762.0s	1762.0	 call it back to the 2000s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1764.8s	1764.8	 The last three major drawdowns have been the dot com crash, then the financial crisis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1770.3s	1770.3	 and then the covid crash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1771.8s	1771.8	 And all of them had true systemic risk that caused kind of there's all these ripple effects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1776.9s	1776.9	 and secondary effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1778.3s	1778.3	 And to me, I mean, you know, and for all you guys, it seems to me that this time what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1783.8s	1783.8	 is a devaluation that doesn't have systemic risk attached to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1787.8s	1787.8	 If these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1788.2s	1788.2	 Well, we had this happen in 2018 because in 2018, it looked like there was going to be inflation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1795.8s	1795.8	 Powell, you know, basically killed the market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1799.1s	1799.1	 He raised rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1800.6s	1800.6	 And then it turned out he was completely wrong and China was OK and everything was fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1805.9s	1805.9	 And then the market just completely violently snapped back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1808.6s	1808.6	 Again, this is what I'm saying, which is it's too early to tell whether this is just a short term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1813.7s	1813.7	 opportunity for people who have made a lot of money to de risk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1816.9s	1816.9	 And again, Satya Nadella just sold 300 million a stock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1820.2s	1820.2	 And we want to sell 10 position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1821.8s	1821.8	 It was half of this position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1823.0s	1823.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1823.3s	1823.3	 I mean, that's that to me was significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1825.2s	1825.2	 Elon Musk sold, you know, 10 billion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1827.3s	1827.3	 I've sold almost I think, six or seven hundred million dollars worth of stuff this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1832.8s	1832.8	 Like this is what I think smart market participants do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1835.8s	1835.8	 You don't just wait and just try to mark to market the last tick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1839.4s	1839.4	 So you think there is systemic risk in here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1841.7s	1841.7	 Yeah. I mean, so we'll look first of all, what's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1844.0s	1844.0	 I mean, Chamath is right that over the last four weeks, we've seen a 30 to 50 percent decline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1848.4s	1848.4	 in these tech growth stocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1849.8s	1849.8	 What is the reason for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1850.9s	1850.9	 Interest rate expectations driven by inflation for the first six months of the year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1855.1s	1855.1	 All you heard out of Washington, the administration was this inflation was transitory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1859.1s	1859.1	 That story is basically that collapsed because now people can see that's persistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1864.1s	1864.1	 They're now pricing in the risk of interest rate increases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1868.5s	1868.5	 Sax, you're breaking up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1869.7s	1869.7	 He's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1870.2s	1870.2	 He's toast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1870.6s	1870.6	 He's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1871.1s	1871.1	 He's toast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1871.7s	1871.7	 I think the Fed just cut him off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1874.2s	1874.2	 He got cut off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1875.1s	1875.1	 He's probably still talking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1876.2s	1876.2	 He's probably still talking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1877.1s	1877.1	 He's on a monologue right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1878.2s	1878.2	 He's got a he's got a he's cutting it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1880.5s	1880.5	 Yeah. Henry Bell Castor can tick tock him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1882.2s	1882.2	 Well, whoever wrote this this part of the speech that he has prepared for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1886.0s	1886.0	 Yeah, that's super crestful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1887.7s	1887.7	 They're like, oh, that was my best speech writing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1889.8s	1889.8	 I think that guy's name is I'm sure it's annotated so he can go back to that point in his diatrace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1894.4s	1894.4	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1895.0s	1895.0	 Yes. I mean, I think actually this is an AI version.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1897.9s	1897.9	 This is like a deep fake of Sax that we just played.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1900.9s	1900.9	 At this point for this moment, the Sax, we reboot the Sax simulation, the Sax simulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1905.8s	1905.8	 Well, I mean, if you if we look at private markets, it's obvious that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1909.7s	1909.7	 you know, they were getting ahead of themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1911.5s	1911.5	 And I think to your point, Shemath, when we were talking before about what a private
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1915.5s	1915.5	 market company is doing in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1917.6s	1917.6	 Well, you know, I was advising them if you can get at a high valuation and you can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1922.0s	1922.0	 clean terms, you take the money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1923.4s	1923.4	 Sure. If it's from quality investors, but just make sure that you have enough runway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1928.5s	1928.5	 to fill into this valuation if there is valuation compression, which is what there is now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1932.8s	1932.8	 So the idea that a private company with 20 million or 30 million in SaaS revenue was worth 50, 60,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1938.6s	1938.6	 70 times that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1940.1s	1940.1	 That's not the case right now in the public markets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1942.2s	1942.2	 And maybe it goes back down to 20 or 30, but you just have to have that runway to land the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1945.8s	1945.8	 playing, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1946.3s	1946.3	 Yeah. One way to think about that is it's less about people often use that high multiple to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1951.7s	1951.7	 refer to this year's numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1953.5s	1953.5	 But what the market is doing typically in those situations is they're saying the multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1958.3s	1958.3	 in the future will be X.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1959.8s	1959.8	 And so they're saying we project five, 10 years out this revenue and I'm paying one to five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1965.0s	1965.0	 times revenue, you know, for seven to 10 years out or whatever the right kind of way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1968.6s	1968.6	 they're framing that up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1969.8s	1969.8	 But then the commentators on the market pricing come in and they say, hey, you guys are crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1974.6s	1974.6	 You're paying 100 times revenue and the market isn't thinking about this year's revenue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1978.6s	1978.6	 They're thinking about revenue in your seven through 10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1981.0s	1981.0	 Yes, that giving credit, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1982.5s	1982.5	 They're giving credit, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1983.6s	1983.6	 Yeah. And they can't do that now because interest rates, let's say interest rates climb to three and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1987.9s	1987.9	 a half percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1988.6s	1988.6	 I can go make three and a half percent by putting my money in for a 10 year bond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1992.2s	1992.2	 And now I can't kind of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1993.8s	1993.8	 And so I have to discount that future back from 10 years out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1997.0s	1997.0	 And now I'm only going to be able to value it in five years out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=1999.4s	1999.4	 So now my revenue for five years out is like a little bit lower and the multiple I'm going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2002.8s	2002.8	 to give them a little lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2003.4s	2003.4	 So the valuation today gets a little bit lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2005.7s	2005.7	 And that's how these things kind of translate as a function of interest rates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2009.6s	2009.6	 It's a little bit harder to make a bet on a 10 year horizon because interest rates are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2014.9s	2014.9	 no longer zero percent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2016.9s	2016.9	 So you have to kind of make a bet on a five year horizon or a three year horizon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2020.4s	2020.4	 And if interest rates are really high, you're betting on this year's numbers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2024.4s	2024.4	 Chamath, I think we should talk a little bit about this inflation concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2027.8s	2027.8	 I did a little tweet storm about this sort of transitory versus perpetual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2034.3s	2034.3	 And I do think we've talked about it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2036.0s	2036.0	 We've crossed that rubric on of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2039.7s	2039.7	 Everybody is raising prices because everybody else is raising prices, not necessarily even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2044.0s	2044.0	 because they are experiencing higher costs in their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2048.2s	2048.2	 But they're just like, you know, my haircuts costing more, my stakes costing more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2051.9s	2051.9	 I've got to charge more for whatever my services is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2055.1s	2055.1	 Is there any way to unwind this inflation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2059.6s	2059.6	 It seems to me like the reason we've had no inflation for so many decades of our entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2064.6s	2064.6	 lives, like I mean, jeans in the 1980s cost the same as jeans now was because of globalization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2069.8s	2069.8	 and efficiency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2071.0s	2071.0	 Well, that took what three decades or four decades of just constant innovation and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2076.7s	2076.7	 constant globalization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2077.7s	2077.7	 Well, we've already got globalization maxed out, perhaps too much globalization, right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2082.4s	2082.4	 that we learned that we actually have risk associated with this, you know, supply chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2087.6s	2087.6	 And how much more efficiency is there in making a pair of jeans?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2090.2s	2090.2	 I don't know if we're going to be making them in a slurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2092.4s	2092.4	 So is there a path to unwind it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2096.0s	2096.0	 You know, rich people not having their equities be worth as much then maybe it trickles down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2100.7s	2100.7	 It's unprecedented, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2102.0s	2102.0	 I think what happens in the stock market is absolutely irrelevant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2106.6s	2106.6	 It doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2107.4s	2107.4	 I mean, you know, we focus on it a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2110.2s	2110.2	 But, you know, when we talk about the core structural economy, the stock market is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2114.9s	2114.9	 lagging indicator of a whole bunch of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2118.5s	2118.5	 Sometimes it's cash flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2119.8s	2119.8	 A lot of the times it's emotion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2122.2s	2122.2	 Money supply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2123.3s	2123.3	 Money supply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2123.9s	2123.9	 I think that there's a much more important thing which we've talked about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2127.7s	2127.7	 which is that, you know, we have said and I have said that coming out of the pandemic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2132.7s	2132.7	 we are moving the world back into a more, you know, decentralized place, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2139.4s	2139.4	 The centralization was this just in time, you know, single supply chain, single point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2144.9s	2144.9	 of failure existence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2146.8s	2146.8	 And if you look inside of China, the thing that they want more than anything else is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2151.0s	2151.0	 become even more centralized, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2154.1s	2154.1	 I don't know if you saw today, but there was an article in the Wall Street Journal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2157.3s	2157.3	 about how China is going to create basically an overall holding company to own all the rare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2164.2s	2164.2	 earths that are made inside of China and then to apportion them out as they see fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2169.8s	2169.8	 So the government will now control a critical element and supply chain into climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2176.2s	2176.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2176.5s	2176.5	 So they're creating their own OPEC in a way, like their own version.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2180.0s	2180.0	 It's a very good way of saying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2181.2s	2181.2	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2181.6s	2181.6	 So China is pushing more and more for centralization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2184.9s	2184.9	 We, so for example, you know, myself and Fortress, we did this deal a few, a year ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2190.5s	2190.5	 to bring this company public called MP Materials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2192.8s	2192.8	 And the whole idea was to start to build diversity in the supply chain, to build a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2197.0s	2197.0	 decentralized supply of all kinds of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2199.8s	2199.8	 In that case, it was around these rare earths because we saw this thing happening in China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2203.7s	2203.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2204.6s	2204.6	 The problem is those kinds of investments are very much few and far between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2208.7s	2208.7	 So the solution to fixing the core structural inflation we have is going to take a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2216.6s	2216.6	 It's going to take trillions of dollars of investment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2219.1s	2219.1	 And more than that, I think it's going to take an enormous amount of coordination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2223.8s	2223.8	 between private and public participants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2226.0s	2226.0	 And I think that that's where this whole thing fails, which is why, you know, I'm a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2232.0s	2232.0	 more concerned about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2233.3s	2233.3	 Like, and I think I've explained this to you, but look, we have massively under invested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2240.1s	2240.1	 in the level of infrastructure we need to support ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2245.8s	2245.8	 Yeah, we outsource it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2247.0s	2247.0	 Like, as in a simple example, like starting in 2016, we absolutely decapitated the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2252.5s	2252.5	 for the United States to invest in our own true energy independence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2256.9s	2256.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2257.7s	2257.7	 You know, the level of fracking, the level of Nat gas oil,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2261.7s	2261.7	 all of this stuff basically fell off of a cliff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2263.8s	2263.8	 And you would say, well, that was the right capital allocation decision because of climate change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2268.2s	2268.2	 Well, it turns out today, not really, because we have absolutely no investments on the climate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2272.8s	2272.8	 change side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2273.5s	2273.5	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2273.8s	2273.8	 We don't have rare earths, we don't have lithium, we don't have nickel, we don't have cobalt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2277.5s	2277.5	 we don't have graphite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2279.0s	2279.0	 So we actually can't make the batteries, which means that now oil is at $100 a barrel and gas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2284.9s	2284.9	 costs 10 bucks at the pump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2287.0s	2287.0	 So that was a coordination problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2288.8s	2288.8	 Really, the right thing to have done would have been to continue to invest in our domestic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2291.8s	2291.8	 supply chain for energy, while we also created incentives to decarbonize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2297.1s	2297.1	 So this is what I mean by these issues have been building up for years, Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2300.6s	2300.6	 Yeah, decades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2301.8s	2301.8	 Inflation is now here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2303.5s	2303.5	 I think it's here to last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2304.8s	2304.8	 I've been pretty consistent about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2307.4s	2307.4	 And this is the real reason why we're going to have a few years of pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2312.7s	2312.7	 And so money losing unprofitable businesses selling future cash flows in 10 to 12 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2318.6s	2318.6	 I mean, some people will buy them, but I won't be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2321.9s	2321.9	 I just sent you a link to freight rates for cargo ships coming from China to LA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2330.9s	2330.9	 And you'll see in the last, you know, call it month and a half or so, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2338.9s	2338.9	 starting was the peak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2339.8s	2339.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2340.4s	2340.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2340.6s	2340.6	 So starting in April, it was like, whatever $2,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2343.1s	2343.1	 And it climbed up to nearly 20 nearly went 10x over that period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2347.0s	2347.0	 And then in September, it started to decline, it's dropped by 50%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2349.8s	2349.8	 And it's continuing to drop week after week right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2353.0s	2353.0	 And we're seeing the same in lumber prices right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2355.1s	2355.1	 I'll send you another link to how lumber prices have kind of declined precipitously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2359.7s	2359.7	 also from an early part of the year peak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2363.0s	2363.0	 And we're seeing this across a lot of these kind of supply markets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2367.7s	2367.7	 where we were talking about inflation being the driver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2371.0s	2371.0	 And some of the other, you know, a lot of the economists of the Fed and other policy makers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2374.8s	2374.8	 were talking about these being kind of transitory pricing effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2377.9s	2377.9	 And so there's a bit of a mixed bag emerging, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2380.0s	2380.0	 We are seeing in some of these markets that prices have declined by 50, 75%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2385.4s	2385.4	 in just the last few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2386.6s	2386.6	 By the way, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2387.3s	2387.3	 As the supply chain distortions have sort of right-sized and the demand and the supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2391.4s	2391.4	 started to balance out a bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2393.4s	2393.4	 And that's creating, I think, you know, a better kind of certainty around pricing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2397.9s	2397.9	 better reliability on these supply chains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2400.1s	2400.1	 And a lot of folks estimate that this will take all the way through 2022
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2403.4s	2403.4	 for that supply chain kind of glut and mismatch to work its way all the way through to the consumer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2407.5s	2407.5	 Indigestion, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2407.8s	2407.8	 Yeah, to the consumer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2409.0s	2409.0	 And so there are a number of points of view that say, look, these pricing issues that we've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2414.5s	2414.5	 seeing in the recent term may, in fact, still be transitory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2418.3s	2418.3	 We may see them work their way out at the end of 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2420.4s	2420.4	 And we're starting to see the early signs of that actually playing out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2424.0s	2424.0	 And so I would say the jury is still out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2426.2s	2426.2	 Generally, we've obviously doubled the amount of US dollars that are in supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2429.5s	2429.5	 or increased it by 50% a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2431.4s	2431.4	 We've got interest rates at zero.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2435.6s	2435.6	 People aren't going to reduce their wages, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2438.0s	2438.0	 Wages are only going to go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2440.0s	2440.0	 And there's a lot of things that you make the point of, like spending is only going to go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2442.8s	2442.8	 The government's never going to spend less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2444.2s	2444.2	 By the way, just on that point, the government changed their formula
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2450.5s	2450.5	 for what is considered a conforming mortgage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2452.5s	2452.5	 I think it kicks in in January.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2454.0s	2454.0	 And essentially, it basically allows US homeowners to have a million-dollar mortgage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2458.0s	2458.0	 and have it essentially be conforming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2460.1s	2460.1	 Now, that's a pretty large increase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2462.4s	2462.4	 I think it's almost 20% from what it used to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2464.7s	2464.7	 Why is that important?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2466.1s	2466.1	 Think of the amount of money that's stuck in US real estate by US homeowners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2470.5s	2470.5	 who now all of a sudden can have conforming loans that are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2474.3s	2474.3	 which used to be jumbos or superjumbos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2477.2s	2477.2	 So worse terms become better terms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2479.7s	2479.7	 You have more equity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2480.9s	2480.9	 You can pull out more money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2482.9s	2482.9	 I think that people will spend that money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2484.6s	2484.6	 And so even on the consumer side, I think that you have an impetus to spend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2489.2s	2489.2	 The one thing I wanted to say, I wanted to clarify something I said earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2493.6s	2493.6	 It's very difficult to buy these long-dated businesses promising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2497.8s	2497.8	 huge cash flows in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2499.8s	2499.8	 There is one kind of version of that company, though, that you can buy, in my opinion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2503.6s	2503.6	 and what I am still buying, which is deep physical science and R&D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2509.1s	2509.1	 Because those businesses, in some ways, are still on a risk-adjusted basis, in my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2514.7s	2514.7	 Great bets to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2516.0s	2516.0	 But otherwise, you want to be allocated to-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2518.2s	2518.2	 Spending a lot of money on research and are going to have future products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2521.0s	2521.0	 It doesn't necessarily have to be a lot of money, but that the outcome in success is so asymmetric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2527.2s	2527.2	 Those are really interesting to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2528.8s	2528.8	 Businesses in moments like this where, if I'm delevering my portfolio,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2533.8s	2533.8	 that's how I'm thinking about it, which is I want to make those kind of bets in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2537.1s	2537.1	 The one thing I think that could help unwind this, and I think it's to your point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2541.4s	2541.4	 Friedberg, about some of the indigestion is starting to work its way through the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2546.2s	2546.2	 There could be two things occurring at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2549.5s	2549.5	 We could have more money supply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2551.3s	2551.3	 Prices could be going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2552.5s	2552.5	 Homes could be going up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2553.7s	2553.7	 Lumber could be coming down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2554.6s	2554.6	 But that doesn't mean that the person constructing the home is just going to magically say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2558.2s	2558.2	 oh, wow, I spent less on lumber.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2559.8s	2559.8	 I can take a million dollars off the price of this new home or $100,000, even, whatever it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2564.2s	2564.2	 But competition does seem to drive prices lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2566.6s	2566.6	 And so if we do see more people participating as employees or employment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2572.1s	2572.1	 well, then there'd be some competition for less competition for labor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2577.1s	2577.1	 And we might see more competition other places in the economy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2580.5s	2580.5	 If there were more cars available, obviously, people will try to win customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2585.0s	2585.0	 Right now, you don't have to win a customer if you're selling a car, even a used one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2588.0s	2588.0	 they're going for 10, 20 K used cars are going people who bought used cars two years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2594.1s	2594.1	 are selling them for the same price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2595.5s	2595.5	 So they got two years for free in their car, even though they put 10,000 miles on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2599.9s	2599.9	 By the way, speaking about employment for a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2602.0s	2602.0	 you know, the the I heard I saw the stat was pretty insane, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2607.0s	2607.0	 about 2.1 million people under immigrated to the United States at the beginning of Trump's tenure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2615.3s	2615.3	 as president.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2616.6s	2616.6	 What that means is that what that what that means is that we lost about 2.1 million immigrants,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2621.8s	2621.8	 then we would have normally based on the run rate of how immigration should have worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2625.9s	2625.9	 So whether that was people being rejected at the border, or whether that was just people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2629.8s	2629.8	 deciding not to come to the United States because of their feelings for Trump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2633.2s	2633.2	 we lost 2.1 million eligible workers over the those four years of his presidency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2638.5s	2638.5	 We also had a bunch of people who had degrees in certain jobs who basically gave up on their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2643.6s	2643.6	 profession. And we talked about this before, which is, you know, the teacher who decides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2647.1s	2647.1	 it's better off to just go work at Amazon, right, then actually be a teacher, because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2651.0s	2651.0	 you actually get paid more now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2653.0s	2653.0	 And then the third thing is that there's a ton of people that are making an enormous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2658.0s	2658.0	 amount of money through inheritance, and through their parents who are boomers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2662.4s	2662.4	 who are now in their 60s, 70s and 80s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2665.2s	2665.2	 And all of that is exacerbating this employment problem, which you can only solve by raising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2670.1s	2670.1	 wages, right? There's a ton of more people in the country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2673.4s	2673.4	 Well, all of it just means that there are just fewer people to do the work, which means you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2677.2s	2677.2	 going to have to pay more to get the work done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2679.9s	2679.9	 Yeah, we're gonna or we could let more people in the country based on their specific skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2683.8s	2683.8	 You put these two things together, structural inflation is here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2687.0s	2687.0	 We've under invested under invested at the macro level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2690.8s	2690.8	 And we've completely distorted people's incentives to work at the micro level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2695.6s	2695.6	 Prices go up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2697.0s	2697.0	 One thing I'm seeing in the market, and I think David's back with us, David Sachs, is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2702.0s	2702.0	 Keith, for boy had this tweet, and I think we talked about a four or five episodes ago, a bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2705.7s	2705.7	 of capital allocators are saying, you know what was a great run, but I think I'm going to opt out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2712.4s	2712.4	 I'm going to move on to my next adventure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2714.7s	2714.7	 I don't want to deal with what we're dealing with here on this podcast, which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2719.6s	2719.6	 what do you even make of this confluence of the pandemic crypto, you know, printing more money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2726.4s	2726.4	 supply, and interest and unknowable valuations in the face of massive technological change from AI,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2734.8s	2734.8	 biology, etc. So I thought it'd be interesting to talk about all of our decisions to stay in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2739.9s	2739.9	 capital allocation game and what we think about this retiring group of capital allocators who are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2745.7s	2745.7	 let's face it, retiring at 50 or-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2747.3s	2747.3	 Well, I had coffee with Keith this morning, and then he tweeted that on the heels of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2751.2s	2751.2	 conversation. So I think I can provide a little more insight into what he was thinking there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2755.0s	2755.0	 I think part of the backdrop here is the concern that we're going into a very different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2760.3s	2760.3	 environment than the one we've had over the last 10 years. I mean, over the last 10 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2764.2s	2764.2	 we've basically had record good times because of this low interest rate environment, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2771.3s	2771.3	 And low interest rate environments are fantastic for growth stocks. Now, it looks like we're moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2776.4s	2776.4	 into an environment in which inflation is certainly not transitory. We don't know how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2781.8s	2781.8	 long it's going to last for. And that creates an expectation of which rates are going to rise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2786.3s	2786.3	 And so the next decade may not be as good for growth stocks. And you've also had over the last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2790.6s	2790.6	 year or two, price levels have been much higher. So you've got to figure there's a whole cohort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2794.9s	2794.9	 VCs who've had a great decade, who've made a lot of money. And now they're asking, does it really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2799.3s	2799.3	 make sense for me to sign up for another decade that may not look as good? And the truth is if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2805.0s	2805.0	 you're not the principal of your firm, if you're one of 20 partners, it doesn't make as much sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2810.9s	2810.9	 for you to stay in the game when you've just had a fantastic decade. You've probably made more money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2815.0s	2815.0	 than you thought you were going to make. And now you're not so sure about the next one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2817.8s	2817.8	 Pre-Bury Thoughts? I mean, you still want to build companies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2821.4s	2821.4	 Yeah, I'm like, I don't know, I like building stuff and building new stuff that's kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2827.0s	2827.0	 going to have a, you know, an impact and it's technically difficult. So that's kind of where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2832.3s	2832.3	 I get drawn to spend my time. But I can understand people whose job it is to kind of manage other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2837.2s	2837.2	 people's money and invest it for them. You know, and they participate in the profits they generate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2843.6s	2843.6	 Realizing after some period of time, like, hey, I've bought a bunch of lottery tickets. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2847.4s	2847.4	 if you buy lottery tickets at the local 7-Eleven every day, and one day you hit the $12 million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2852.6s	2852.6	 jackpot, you're not going back to 7-Eleven the next day to keep buying lottery tickets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2857.8s	2857.8	 And so, you know, in the context of being a money manager to generate returns, and that being kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2863.8s	2863.8	 of your principal interest, and you kind of hit a return outcome that statistically, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2868.8s	2868.8	 will not happen again, I don't see the point of the hassle of going back to work. I could see the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2872.8s	2872.8	 psychology of saying that that's enough for me. I do think, however, most VCs are truly, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2879.8s	2879.8	 we can kind of generalize all we want. But as we all know, we have lots of friends who are VCs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2884.9s	2884.9	 And I'd say generally, the majority of them are very intellectually curious and driven. And what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2890.8s	2890.8	 I am seeing is a shift of people who have had successful investing track records and have had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2896.9s	2896.9	 massive outcomes, shifting their attention now, they take some time off. And I'd say almost 100%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2903.4s	2903.4	 come back and they always ask for a meeting and I'm like, sure. And then they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2907.1s	2907.1	 I want to work on climate change solutions. And so what I'm seeing is this kind of second act
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2912.0s	2912.0	 happening now. And we've seen it with guys like Chris Sokka and, you know, folks who had these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2916.1s	2916.1	 massive, massive outcomes in their first run. They know they're not going to, you know, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2920.0s	2920.0	 statistical likelihood of doing that again is very low. But then, you know, after spending a couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2924.2s	2924.2	 years on the ranch or, you know, surfing, you kind of wake up and you're like, hey, I want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2927.6s	2927.6	 something meaningful with my life. Like, I got kids, I look them in the eye. And I'm like, what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2930.7s	2930.7	 should we do to get what do I want to do for the future for my children? And they all kind of come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2934.8s	2934.8	 back around. So one of the things I'm seeing is this kind of second act phenomenon, where VCs are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2942.0s	2942.0	 moving away from being pure play technologists and making money to saying I want to do stuff that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2946.8s	2946.8	 a little bit more meaningful and altruistic coming into climate change. And as a result,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2950.0s	2950.0	 we're seeing insane funding happening in climate change tech companies or climate tech or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2956.4s	2956.4	 the heck the label is this week, stuff that in my opinion doesn't make any sense, businesses that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2961.3s	2961.3	 aren't real businesses, technologies that don't actually make sense, it'll never work out. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2965.1s	2965.1	 hey, that's always been the case in venture, right? One out of 1000 works and you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2968.5s	2968.5	 changes the world. But we are seeing that and that's kind of a personal observation is I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2972.6s	2972.6	 seeing a lot of these second acts going after climate change. Chamatha, this last year is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2978.2s	2978.2	 or 18 months, pretty exhausting as a capital allocator to try to make sense of the world and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2982.1s	2982.1	 get your bearings. It's like going through multiple storms. Does that make you more engaged? I get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2987.6s	2987.6	 sense knowing you for a long time. That you and I might be similar. Yeah, the chessboards are getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2993.7s	2993.7	 mixed up the pieces and the values are getting changed, whatever it's making me more excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=2997.8s	2997.8	 to participate and try to figure it out. Yeah, it's like a hand to poker to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3001.8s	3001.8	 I'm more intellectually stimulated now. Me too. I'm the most engaged I've ever been. Yeah, I,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3008.8s	3008.8	 I mean, look, I, I left the money management business five years ago, I guess. And honestly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3017.6s	3017.6	 it was a very hard path, but it's been the most rewarding. Because I was able to focus on on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3023.8s	3023.8	 things that I wanted. Look, if you do this job, well, this job is voting for change with your money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3031.0s	3031.0	 And making change using money. And that's great, because money is not that useful beyond a very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3037.0s	3037.0	 small amount. And then you have to question like, what are your real priorities? So yeah, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3043.4s	3043.4	 grinding away at something that matters to me, I've always find fulfilling. And I feel like I am an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3050.3s	3050.3	 athlete whose muscle doesn't decay by my mid 30s, but probably decays in my 70s or 80s, which is my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3060.0s	3060.0	 brain. And so, you know, I'm only, you know, I'm only I'm a rookie. So I'm excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3067.5s	3067.5	 The fact that things are compressing, or maybe there'll be less startups or less capital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3071.3s	3071.3	 allocators involved, what I've seen in my career, it post.com era web 2.0, amazing time to be alive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3077.6s	3077.6	 amazing time, because there were less anybody who started a company after the dot com bust,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3081.9s	3081.9	 or after the 2008 financial crisis, was a legitimate warrior who wanted to change the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3087.8s	3087.8	 and was incredibly focused. And then the sense of entitlement I'm seeing on all sides of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3092.2s	3092.2	 table right now, from founders to board members to investors, it just seems like everybody's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3097.4s	3097.4	 in some sort of mad dash to secure some bag, by any means necessary. And there's no focus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3103.0s	3103.0	 the customers and the product and the team. Everybody's, you know, living in some just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3108.2s	3108.2	 manic, you know, grab money grab, you know, when you're in the middle of a paintball war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3113.1s	3113.1	 you know, you're trying to, you're trying to shoot the paintball gun, and you're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3115.8s	3115.8	 hit people and it's a little bit crazy on the field. But you know, as everyone kind of gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3119.9s	3119.9	 back to the locker room, and they take their win, you know, all humans ultimately are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3125.5s	3125.5	 driven by a desire to leave something in the world to make an impact of some sort. And at some point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3130.9s	3130.9	 all all the folks who have made a ton of money in this cycle, there were a lot of folks who made a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3134.7s	3134.7	 ton of money in the last cycle, are kind of asking themselves, you know, how do I leave an impact?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3138.8s	3138.8	 How do I make an impact in the world? And I still have a skill set, and I still have a capability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3143.0s	3143.0	 do so. And so then there's this search for meaning. And, and that's where you see kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3148.2s	3148.2	 the climate change and the health care and all these other kind of paths start to form for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3153.0s	3153.0	 I do think web three also offers another path of opportunity for folks, where they can kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3157.9s	3157.9	 rewrite the internet and think about how to reinvent the social model for humanity, the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3164.6s	3164.6	 economic model for humanity, the governance model for humanity, the communications model for humanity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3169.4s	3169.4	 And web three creates that that kind of, you know, that that visionary kind of platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3176.5s	3176.5	 opportunity, and folks are all kind of excited about what's next. So, you know, once the dust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3180.8s	3180.8	 settles a little bit, and you put some money in your pocket, and you realize, you know, it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3184.3s	3184.3	 going to change your life more than you know, did last week. And, you know, you want to make an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3189.0s	3189.0	 impact, and then folks kind of come back and they start pursuing, you know, where impact will lie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3194.0s	3194.0	 Let's go to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3196.2s	3196.2	 Sax, what was Reboy? What was Reboy talking about? What were you guys talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3200.8s	3200.8	 In this breakfast, Keith, and I just talked about how we're about to enter a very different kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3205.6s	3205.6	 macro environment for growth stocks. And we don't know how long it's going to take. But there's no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3212.8s	3212.8	 question that multiples and valuations are going to come down. And there's a lot of younger founders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3217.9s	3217.9	 and investors who never lived through a bear market or a down cycle, and they're about to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3223.0s	3223.0	 get a rude awakening. So look, I think it's a little different for us, because we're all principles at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3228.2s	3228.2	 our firms. And so therefore, if we're not happy about something, we could simply effectuate a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3233.1s	3233.1	 change in strategy. But if you're one of 20 partners at a giant firm, even if you're the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3238.6s	3238.6	 most successful one, it's hard for you to move that ship. And, you know, your returns get divided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3243.8s	3243.8	 by, you know, it's one over n, where n is the number of like full partner shares. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3250.1s	3250.1	 if you just made a ton of money over the last 10 years, and you're thinking about whether you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3253.8s	3253.8	 to sign up for going through a bunch of choppy waters, there's a lot of good reasons right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3259.8s	3259.8	 for people to reevaluate. Now, look, Keith and I were both discussing this in the context of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3264.2s	3264.2	 hey, this would be great for us, because we're not going anywhere. But Keith did think that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3270.2s	3270.2	 because the macro picture is changing, that is one more reason for people who are on the fence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3276.1s	3276.1	 and thinking about retiring to move forward with that. All right. So I think we've talked about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3281.5s	3281.5	 capital allocation, and we got the variant, and we got the markets. Can I just point out how like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3287.0s	3287.0	 Zach, it seems like you and J Cal and everyone are kind of in Miami at Art Basel. And this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3291.7s	3291.7	 thing's been going on for years. And it's a art fair. Yeah, but it's like tech has taken it over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3297.0s	3297.0	 Like, the tech industry, yeah, like the tech community seems has this kind of consistent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3302.5s	3302.5	 trend of going to these like esoteric kind of call it originally artistically created events
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3310.2s	3310.2	 and spaces. It was like Sundance, and then it was Burning Man. And now it's like Miami Art Basel and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3314.6s	3314.6	 kind of ruining it, ruining it, taking it for themselves. You know, hey, now it's tech week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3319.6s	3319.6	 in Miami. But it was like, it's Art Basel has been going on for forever. It's NFT Basel, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3323.9s	3323.9	 calling it. NFT Basel. Yeah. It's brutal. It's literally bad for all the real creatives. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3329.3s	3329.3	 Yeah. We're the ugly Americans who come in and ruin the artisanal, you know, feel of the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3335.1s	3335.1	 And it's like a place with cash. But look, no, one difference between Florida or Miami in particular,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3341.4s	3341.4	 and California and San Francisco in particular, is nobody hates money or success over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3347.0s	3347.0	 They're happy for, you know, all these rich people to come in and spend their money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3352.0s	3352.0	 They really believe in capitalism over here. You've got this huge Cuban immigrant population

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3361.8s	3361.8	 And I mean, they teach their kids in schools the evils of socialism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3366.2s	3366.2	 So yeah, nobody here is looking to purge the rich. That's nice. It's funny,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3370.9s	3370.9	 Saks, because the Bay Area, right, the Bay Area has a huge South Asian population, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3376.9s	3376.9	 And a huge immigrant population. Why is that not the case in California, right? Why is this huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3383.2s	3383.2	 immigrant population, whether they come from South America, Latin America, or they come from South
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3389.0s	3389.0	 Asia, India, China? Do we not have the same sort of response here for, you know, pushback against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3395.0s	3395.0	 socialist tendencies and the push for capitalism and entrepreneurism? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3399.8s	3399.8	 The big difference in South Florida is that those immigrant communities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3403.0s	3403.0	 were politically active and got really ingrained in the political process. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3408.0s	3408.0	 they were a loud voice. You know, systemically, what happens in South Asian families is we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3413.5s	3413.5	 don't do that. It's just not a thing. And in fact, if you look inside of our countries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3418.2s	3418.2	 the politicians are just the absolute sketchiest, most brutal folks. And so, you know, when you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3425.5s	3425.5	 people that got, you know, double E degrees from IIT, the last thing that they're thinking is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3429.7s	3429.7	 I want to run for mayor of Santa Clara. That doesn't happen. So it's just a big cultural
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3434.5s	3434.5	 distinction between the Chinese and South Asian populations versus the South American populations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3440.0s	3440.0	 I have to say San Francisco has become truly dystopian. I went to San Francisco to see a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3445.0s	3445.0	 comedy show. Hassan Manaj, who is a big fan of this pod. He has an incredible show, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3449.5s	3449.5	 He's fabulous. He's amazing. And he did a show about MBS and him getting into it with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3454.6s	3454.6	 Kingdom and Patriot Act to show it was one of the most powerful, like one man shows I've seen. It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3460.0s	3460.0	 kind of transcends comedy. But I took Sonny, our friend Sonny, and we had a great time. But we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3465.1s	3465.1	 walked through Union Square, because we wanted to get like a drink. We walked through Union Square,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3469.8s	3469.8	 and it was cordoned off with cop cars at every intersection. And there's no cars in the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3475.1s	3475.1	 And I was like, what's going on? Is there some police activity? Or I was like, they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3479.0s	3479.0	 no, the Louis Vuitton store got knocked off. I kid you not, every single store has had every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3484.9s	3484.9	 single window boarded up like it's a hurricane season. But they all did them in pitch black.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3489.4s	3489.4	 So it must have been like one vendor came and did this for every vendor. But like Zara, the Gap,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3495.6s	3495.6	 Nike, every single storefront has been boarded up. And then there are security guards outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3501.8s	3501.8	 and you have to make an appointment to go Christmas shopping. And literally, they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3507.0s	3507.0	 road blockades of multiple cars at every intersection, because the smashing grabs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3512.0s	3512.0	 have become so brazen and dangerous. There were 30 or 40 people involved in that one at the Louis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3516.2s	3516.2	 Vuitton store. Can you imagine your shopping for Christmas and this is this is the logical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3521.8s	3521.8	 windows? This is the logical result or everything I've been warning about since the beginning of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3526.0s	3526.0	 the year, you have prosecutors like Chase Aboudin, who have essentially decriminalized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3530.1s	3530.1	 staff by refusing to prosecute it. After the Louis Vuitton looting, he comes out there says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3536.5s	3536.5	 well, don't bring this noise from out of town. That's what he calls crime is noise. And he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3540.6s	3540.6	 trying to pretend like it's it didn't arise in San Francisco, like somehow it's come from out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3545.5s	3545.5	 town. No, you created it by refusing to prosecute these types of crimes. And then after talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3551.7s	3551.7	 tough, the first thing he did, he already released the police actually caught some of these looters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3557.3s	3557.3	 at the of the LVMH. He has already released zero bail. Exactly. The prison, the jail is a revolving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3565.0s	3565.0	 door. They have zero bail. And so the people who did this already out on bail, Chase talks tough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3570.7s	3570.7	 when he when he charges them. But the charges are never actually brought the play down thrown out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3576.0s	3576.0	 And it is dystopian. And we couldn't find a place to have a drink every single bar was we tried to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3580.4s	3580.4	 have like a post, you know, comedy show drink. And, and by the way, Hassan's a huge fan of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3584.7s	3584.7	 pod. We talked for an hour of the show he brought us backstage is really really class act. We should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3589.0s	3589.0	 have on the pod at some point, do we want to talk about Jack leaving Twitter? Well, there's a segue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3592.7s	3592.7	 here. I mean, Chamath mentioned that, you know, you have these immigrant minorities from South Asia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3599.4s	3599.4	 I'd say Indian Americans, Chinese Americans, they've been spectacularly successful in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3604.0s	3604.0	 United States. Maybe they haven't been as politically active as say, the Cuban Americans or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3609.9s	3609.9	 Argentinian Americans in Florida, but they've been incredibly successful. You had another example of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3615.0s	3615.0	 that this week with Jack leaving Twitter, his replacement is Prague Agarwal. He's an Indian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3620.3s	3620.3	 American. So you now have, you know, Indian immigrants, I guess, first or second generation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3625.5s	3625.5	 running Google with Sundar, Sasha Nadella and Microsoft, the CEO of Adobe Shantanu Narayan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3633.6s	3633.6	 the CEOs of MasterCard, Nokia, and NAP and IBM, all Indian Americans. So there's no question that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3639.5s	3639.5	 people of color can be spectacularly successful in the United States. And I think those communities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3645.5s	3645.5	 are too- Don't mess with the Browns! Hold on, those communities are so busy availing themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3652.5s	3652.5	 of the abundant opportunities for success in this country, that they haven't been basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3658.2s	3658.2	 involved in politics because they haven't been complaining about anything. They've just been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3661.4s	3661.4	 succeeding. Too busy winning. Too busy winning. Yeah, there's a viral joke. If you're a CEO in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3670.7s	3670.7	 Silicon Valley, you live long enough to see yourself replaced by an Indian CEO. That trended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3676.5s	3676.5	 Hallelujah. Look, Satya, you have Satya, Sundar. There's like four or five other examples, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3685.2s	3685.2	 it's now just absolutely a great triumph. It's amazing for our society that a lot of people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3690.6s	3690.6	 are immigrants or sons of immigrants come here and run the largest, most dynamic, important companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3696.2s	3696.2	 in the world. This is an incredible win. And we have to reboot immigration in this country. I believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3701.5s	3701.5	 in this very strongly, that we need to get more intelligent people here. And if you come here for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3705.8s	3705.8	 your degree, we need to staple a green card to your degree when you come up and pick it up on stage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3710.6s	3710.6	 at Stanford or Harvard or whatever, community college. You should stay here and build companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3715.2s	3715.2	 here. We have to really open that up. That was one of the huge failings of the Trump presidency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3720.1s	3720.1	 and now going into Biden, who doesn't seem to care about immigration either. Both of these people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3724.3s	3724.3	 it's huge fails. Both parties do not want to bring intelligent people here. I want to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3729.0s	3729.0	 about Mike Bloomberg's $750 million donation. Okay, that's what we'll end on. Explain to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3733.6s	3733.6	 what happened. He's given $750 million to charter schools. Am I correct? First of all, Mike's a boss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3737.7s	3737.7	 I've known him for 15 years. He is the best. He is an absolute stone cold boss. Killer. Before I tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3745.3s	3745.3	 this story of what he did, you know, Mike was the largest donor to Johns Hopkins. And for years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3750.7s	3750.7	 he would donate without any fanfare. And this is something that I've actually copied from him. I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3755.4s	3755.4	 given money to my alma mater, not anywhere near the same amount as he has. But you know, after he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3761.7s	3761.7	 passed the billion dollars of donations, he made it public. And he was able to make Johns Hopkins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3766.8s	3766.8	 permanently need blind. And so it's kind of like Johns Hopkins became this bastion to attract the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3772.5s	3772.5	 smartest kids period bar none, right? And everybody gets and everybody gets their their way paid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3777.7s	3777.7	 basically. So he announced a program $750 million over the next four or five years, I think to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3784.2s	3784.2	 150,000 kids, Jason, tell me if I got this wrong, into charter schools all around the country. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3790.9s	3790.9	 he basically just talked about how, you know, the pandemic has really let our kids down in every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3797.8s	3797.8	 single way possible. And he had these quotes from the leader of the California teachers union,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3805.5s	3805.5	 and it was so odious to things that she said. And the biggest quote was basically like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3811.4s	3811.4	 you can recall Gavin Newsom, and you can recall the mayor of the city, but you can't recall me. So I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3817.0s	3817.0	 just going to do what I want. And it was it was unbelievable. It was disgusting, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3821.3s	3821.3	 Man, I wish she had one for president. Number one issue I Glenn Yonkin won in Virginia was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3827.3s	3827.3	 that was schools. It was the fact that you had these school lockdowns and closures. And then also,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3831.9s	3831.9	 the parents weren't happy with what's being taught in the schools. And the unions and the politicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3837.7s	3837.7	 are beholden to them are completely arrogant about this and explicitly say to the parents,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3841.7s	3841.7	 you don't get to decide what your way here again, it's right where David, if you read these quotes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3845.9s	3845.9	 in the Wall Street Journal article, it's disgusting. It's disgusting the way this woman talks about our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3851.2s	3851.2	 kids. It's really disgusting. And well, it takes a rare Democrat like Bloomberg to basically stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3856.8s	3856.8	 up to them. I mean, Biden certainly doesn't because they are the number one specialist

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3875.4s	3875.4	 takes an outsider like Bloomberg to understand how they were able to sell so effectively anti choice

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3886.5s	3886.5	 and competition equals better outcomes, better products. That's not up for debate. And somehow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3891.8s	3891.8	 they were able to flip people's thinking that no, no competition in schools was more equitable. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3897.1s	3897.1	 that created more equity in the world. How did they do that? Or how did they pull this up? They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3900.6s	3900.6	 just paid everybody off. They didn't do that. They never gave parents a choice because parents didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3904.7s	3904.7	 know a choice was possible. We took a system. How did we dilute people into thinking? I'll tell you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3911.0s	3911.0	 Yeah, no, they didn't have to dilute people. They just had to basically use their money to pay off a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3915.5s	3915.5	 small cohort of individuals to basically back their own view. That's it. Here's some of her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3921.9s	3921.9	 quotes. If you want to read them. Number one, there's no such thing as learning loss because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3926.3s	3926.3	 Mike Mike was basically saying that you know, these kids have stopped learning and there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3929.8s	3929.8	 huge learning. She said there's no such thing as learning loss. She said in an interview with LA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3936.4s	3936.4	 magazine, our kids didn't lose anything. It's okay that hold on, it's okay that our babies may not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3942.3s	3942.3	 have learned their times tables. They learned resilience. That's honestly that's a crock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3948.2s	3948.2	 That's a crock of who is this person? And how do we get her out of office? And what is she like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3952.5s	3952.5	 But but the money the money quote was this one, you can recall the governor, you can recall the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3957.0s	3957.0	 school board. But how are you going to recall me? That's really come on, really fate. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3963.6s	3963.6	 Sax, you have a purple pack. This is this is Cecily Cecily, my art crews, the head of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3969.8s	3969.8	 Los Angeles teachers, somebody start recall Cecily dot org, we'll recall all of them. I think this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3973.9s	3973.9	 recalling trend is brilliant. Like if people are absolutely not doing their job, yes, recall them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3979.5s	3979.5	 she should be allowed obviously, to be a great representative for LA school teachers and fight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3984.7s	3984.7	 on their behalf. That's what unions and union leaders are supposed to do. But something tells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3989.4s	3989.4	 me between that goal, and how she expressed herself here, something has happened and that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3994.7s	3994.7	 corrupted her go to market, if you will, that I think is really scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=3998.6s	3998.6	 It's a tell she she has an arrogance there in those quotes. That's just obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4003.4s	4003.4	 Look, the thing about these policies, progressive policies is they hurt the communities that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4008.8s	4008.8	 that they pretend to be speaking for the most. And so who is hurt by learning loss the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4014.1s	4014.1	 it's disadvantaged kids who can't afford to get private tutors. The exact same thing is true of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4020.5s	4020.5	 defund the police and this decarceration and deprosecution. The communities that get hit the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4025.3s	4025.3	 hardest are the ones that are exposed to the most crime. They're basically the most impoverished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4030.0s	4030.0	 areas, the rich people can hire private security have high walls, they've engaged communities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4034.9s	4034.9	 And so we're seeing over and over again, this is why Eric Adams, who basically is a pro police guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4039.9s	4039.9	 in New York City, got huge percentages of the votes of minority communities in places like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4044.8s	4044.8	 the Bronx, and Glenn Youngkin did extremely well in Virginia with minority communities. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4051.7s	4051.7	 you know, these, and they tend to be primarily white progressives, like Jason Boudin, like Georgia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4057.3s	4057.3	 Gascon, like Evan, they're the craziest ones. They're the greatest range. They are they are so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4063.5s	4063.5	 deranged. These are these are luxury beliefs that they that they learn. And their virtue signaling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4069.4s	4069.4	 is so just luxury, luxury beliefs. Speaking of crazy well progressive, we just go back to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4075.4s	4075.4	 the Twitter thing for a second, because I think there's a little bit more to say there about Jack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4079.5s	4079.5	 Dorsey stepping down, because I think there's a real fear on the part of a lot of people that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4084.6s	4084.6	 Twitter now is going to slide into even greater censorship like YouTube has, because now you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4090.2s	4090.2	 a CEO who, you know, Parag, who said last year in 2020, there's an article where he basically said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4098.5s	4098.5	 that Twitter does not need to follow the principles of the First Amendment and its content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4103.0s	4103.0	 moderation policy. So here you have a company, I mean, you just look at the bookends of Jack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4107.7s	4107.7	 Dorsey's reign as CEO, and it's really a sharp contrast. You had when Dick Costello was CEO 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4114.1s	4114.1	 years ago, he said, we are the free speech wing of the free speech party. And now to Parag as CEO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4120.4s	4120.4	 Dorsey's handpicked successor 10, 11 years later, basically saying that the First Amendment does not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4125.4s	4125.4	 matter, they don't have to follow it when it comes to their content moderation. So I think it's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4129.6s	4129.6	 a real sea change over there and how they view their mission. They used to be in favor of free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4133.7s	4133.7	 speech, they used to think that what they're doing was democratizing. Now they basically are pushing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4138.3s	4138.3	 this agenda of censorship. You've seen it censorship of opinion of really any opinion that violates the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4145.0s	4145.0	 elite consensus, like on COVID, like on, you know, many of these issues. It could be simpler, David,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4151.9s	4151.9	 it could just be that it's just really hard to run these things at scale. And so they're all just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4155.9s	4155.9	 saying, you know, it's so hard. I don't want to run it anymore. I don't think it's that hard. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4160.2s	4160.2	 so here's the thing. So Mike Solano had a column where he's basically arguing that that Jack Dorsey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4165.4s	4165.4	 was really a secret defender of the First Amendment and the censorship would be even worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4170.2s	4170.2	 or will be once he's gone. I think there's some I agree with that. I agree that it was. Well, let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4175.9s	4175.9	 tell you the part I disagree with. I agree. I agree things are only going to get worse once he's gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4180.1s	4180.1	 Well, no, I know he is for freedom of speech. He just didn't like to have to deal with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4185.4s	4185.4	 government and all these issues. Like I think it just became untenable because of the scale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4189.8s	4189.8	 but he is a free speech guy. But the ones that same with Larry Page, same with Larry Page. Yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4193.8s	4193.8	 this is on a personal basis. We know this. Edmund Burke had a great quote saying that all that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4197.3s	4197.3	 necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. Jack Dorsey may be a good man,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4201.2s	4201.2	 but he did nothing or very little to stop this agenda of censorship. When they came to him and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4206.3s	4206.3	 said they're going to deplatform as sitting president of the United States, all he had to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4209.1s	4209.1	 say was no, no. He had the veto power and he didn't use it. Listen, he'd left. I mean, I hate to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4215.7s	4215.7	 into politics here because people hate this part of the show, but he let he specifically believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4220.1s	4220.1	 that Trump should stay on the platform because he was president and he stood up to people for four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4223.8s	4223.8	 years who told them, get president off. Like everybody was screaming, Trump shouldn't be on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4228.2s	4228.2	 here. And he said, no, he's the president. He should be on that. That was his position. It was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4232.6s	4232.6	 because of January 6th that he took him off. All these guys, Larry, Larry and Sergey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4237.7s	4237.7	 Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, they are all fundamentally free speech people. They believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4246.7s	4246.7	 in the power of the open internet. I remember in the early days at Google, the intention and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4251.6s	4251.6	 the motivation behind the mission of Google was the democratization of access to information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4257.0s	4257.0	 And by creating access to information and making all information, all points of view,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4261.2s	4261.2	 all data available, they believed that democracy would flourish around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4266.1s	4266.1	 And that would enable these things that would allow these societies that were limited in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4270.4s	4270.4	 information, access information to flourish and transform themselves. And I think the challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4274.6s	4274.6	 arises when the political motivation where someone's voice that's being spoken is viewed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4280.1s	4280.1	 and deemed to be harmful or viewed and deemed to be inflammatory or viewed and deemed to be too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4286.3s	4286.3	 violence-inducing. And that's where the push comes to shove in these governance decisions that these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4292.1s	4292.1	 folks end up having to make. It's not an easy position. Fundamentally, philosophically, I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4296.9s	4296.9	 that everyone that's involved in the internet, all technologists, they all have the same intention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4301.4s	4301.4	 and motivation and point of view, but it is so frigging hard to navigate what ends up happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4307.7s	4307.7	 And by the way, look at what happened to 4chan. 4chan was supposed to be this open,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4310.7s	4310.7	 no one's going to touch it. And then there were pictures of people being murdered and rape and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4314.5s	4314.5	 all this other sort of terrible stuff that emerged on 4chan. And then they have to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4318.0s	4318.0	 and same at Reddit, right? Remember the whole controversy around Reddit needing to clamp down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4322.5s	4322.5	 And, you know, Ellen and others got a lot of heat for clamping down on the free speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4328.0s	4328.0	 quote unquote, of what was going on on Reddit. Revenge porn. Yeah, there's like, there's a line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4331.7s	4331.7	 Because there's a line and it's very hard, your point of view on what the line should be and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4335.4s	4335.4	 someone else's point of view on what the line should be is a difference of opinion. And at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4338.9s	4338.9	 the end of the day, opinions are going to drive- And yours, David, is based on your guy getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4342.5s	4342.5	 banned. Let's be clear here. If your guy had a big ban, that's the tip of your spear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4347.1s	4347.1	 No, I think quite frankly, I think the fact that he's off Twitter, I think is frankly great for

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4357.2s	4357.2	 No, I mean, look. Download the Call-In app at App Store right now. Call-In app is available on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4367.9s	4367.9	 I had an incredible barley salad. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4373.8s	4373.8	 I want to respond to what Freeberg said. Okay. So, Freeberg's exactly, closing argument is this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4379.0s	4379.0	 Freeberg is exactly right about where the internet stood 10 years ago. You're right, that Zuck and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4385.0s	4385.0	 Page and Dorsey all believed in the open internet. They believed in the democratizing power of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4389.6s	4389.6	 internet. When the green revolution happened in 2009, everybody was cheering. So, what changed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4395.1s	4395.1	 I'll tell you what changed. In 2016, they got a candidate elected who they didn't like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4400.0s	4400.0	 and their principles were so skin deep, basically so superficial that they completely flipped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4406.4s	4406.4	 because they got one election where there's a result they didn't like. And so, they turned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4409.9s	4409.9	 against democracy. Look, Twitter and democracy worked in 2016. The establishment lost because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4416.5s	4416.5	 they had supported two decades of futile wars in the Middle East, trade policy with China that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4421.6s	4421.6	 hollowed out jobs, border policy that didn't make sense. The American people sent the establishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4427.0s	4427.0	 a message in 2016. The establishment should have taken the note, but they didn't. Instead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4432.8s	4432.8	 what they did is blame social media for disinformation, Russian collusion, hate speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4438.3s	4438.3	 white supremacy, what have you. And since then, they've been on a mission to ban those things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4442.3s	4442.3	 from their social networks. It is a total myth. The reason why Trump won the election in 2016 is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4449.4s	4449.4	 because of the issues he ran on. The establishment should have taken the note. Instead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4453.6s	4453.6	 they've been on this wild goose chase attacking disinformation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4456.2s	4456.2	 Hey, Nick, Nick, can you just edit out that last part of David's? I don't want anybody to hear it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4460.6s	4460.6	 Thank you. Yeah, let's vote David's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4473.6s	4473.6	 Biggest winner here is going to be TikTok because if Twitter does go forward with this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4478.1s	4478.1	 yeah, if they say, look, you can't put user generated content on our platform if it has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4483.3s	4483.3	 video and images of personal of people without their consent and approval, it's going to eliminate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4488.9s	4488.9	 all of this democratization of access to video feeds of riots and crime and all sorts of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4493.6s	4493.6	 Of course. A real big boom. So like, TikTok is not going to do that. TikTok is going to end up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4498.2s	4498.2	 soaking up this whole market, right? For user generated content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4501.4s	4501.4	 Just so everybody knows what we're talking about. The day after Jack left, they said there's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4505.7s	4505.7	 to be a new safety and security again, if you feel unsafe, that's when you get that little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4511.0s	4511.0	 your your antenna should go up. So if you feel unsafe, because somebody posted a picture of you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4516.3s	4516.3	 even if you were in a public space, which is completely valid, you can take a picture of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4519.3s	4519.3	 anybody in a public space, that if you didn't consent and you feel unsafe, then you can have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4523.9s	4523.9	 it taken down. And this has led to people thinking like, you can't take a picture at a Warriors game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4528.0s	4528.0	 of people in the background without getting the 20 people in the row to consent. It's kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4532.6s	4532.6	 a backstop, I think, but it is definitely a very bizarre position to take that people in public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4538.3s	4538.3	 can't have their picture taken because that is a just canonical example of freedom of speech,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4543.5s	4543.5	 and you don't have a right to privacy if you're out in public. So it kind of falls into your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4547.8s	4547.8	 category, David, the policy doesn't make the policy doesn't make any sense. Nobody understands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4551.9s	4551.9	 it is very poorly rolled. It's a logical as well. Look, you could have said a policy of listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4556.5s	4556.5	 if you have a non public person being harassed, you can always take down basically unauthorized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4561.8s	4561.8	 footage of that person, it could have been an harassment policy. Instead, they just banned all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4566.6s	4566.6	 public video footage. And you know, it's gonna be applied selectively. Here's my problem with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4571.0s	4571.0	 disinformation argument, okay, is where are the warning labels or the banning of tweets basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4577.4s	4577.4	 describing Kyle Rittenhouse as a white supremacist cross straight lines with an AR 15. That is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4582.8s	4582.8	 true. Okay, but that message went viral on Twitter, the Steele dossier went viral on Twitter, and yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4588.5s	4588.5	 there are no warning. Hold on a second. There are no warning labels to this day, despite the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4592.9s	4592.9	 that that's been completely debunked. I'm not trying to defend any specific politician in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4597.7s	4597.7	 particular, Jason, I know you think this is all about Trump. It's not. It's about the double
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4602.0s	4602.0	 standard. Okay. These censorship principles only exist. So the employees of the company can censor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4607.5s	4607.5	 one side of the debate, they don't agree with you've got to admit that there is a ton of bias
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp-2AHox1U&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=78&t=4612.9s	4612.9	 in one sidedness in the way these principles are enforced. I agree there's bias. I agree that these
