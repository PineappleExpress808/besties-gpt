https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=160.4s	160.4	 And then after I do it, the first thing you guys say when I walk in the room is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=163.8s	163.8	 Oh my God, you went on Tucker.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=176.4s	176.4	 Jason had premeditated basically getting you to appear on Tucker so as to impugn

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=189.5s	189.5	 All is fair when it comes to early stage deal flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=192.5s	192.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=192.8s	192.8	 And then he starts tweeting, you know, he's like the first one to show a photo of me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=196.8s	196.8	 split screen with Tucker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=197.9s	197.9	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=198.4s	198.4	 I was waiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=199.4s	199.4	 I was, I was literally watching it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=201.4s	201.4	 It's time for the great take down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=203.4s	203.4	 Actually you did in all seriousness, you did great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=206.1s	206.1	 Um, I think it was worth doing and he framed it as, I don't know if people saw it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=210.9s	210.9	 You can look up Tucker Carlson, bestie, David Sacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=214.2s	214.2	 It'll come up number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=215.6s	215.6	 And, um, he said you were, um, essentially taking a very liberal classic liberal point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=223.7s	223.7	 of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=224.3s	224.3	 So he basically set the stage for you to not be a far right wing nut case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=229.9s	229.9	 You were actually defending liberal principles of people should have the ability to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=234.2s	234.2	 freedom of speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=234.8s	234.8	 Why don't you talk about what it was like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=236.4s	236.4	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=236.4s	236.4	 I mean, so, so you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=237.9s	237.9	 I mean, he made the connection and the comparison to net Hentoff, who was like the famous ACLU
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=242.9s	242.9	 free speech lawyer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=243.9s	243.9	 And, uh, and I really appreciated that because I do very much see myself in that mold of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=249.8s	249.8	 uh, of somebody like Hentoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=251.5s	251.5	 He wrote a book called free speech for me, but not for the, um, sort of famous line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=257.3s	257.3	 because everybody wants free speech for themselves and their allies, but they want to deny it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=261.5s	261.5	 to people they disagree with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=263.3s	263.3	 And, you know, they never seem to realize that censorship is a problem until it gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=267.7s	267.7	 turned against them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=269.0s	269.0	 And so, you know, the point I made about the, these Reddit kids who are censored is that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=273.9s	273.9	 look, this, this was not what they, there was some raunchy speech in their message board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=278.4s	278.4	 We all know that, but it was no different than any trading floor, trading pit or boiler
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=282.5s	282.5	 room on wall street, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=284.0s	284.0	 It's the same kind of language yet they were taken down and censored by discord for hate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=288.4s	288.4	 speech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=288.9s	288.9	 Why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=289.5s	289.5	 Because they became very threatening to, you know, powerful insiders and, um, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=295.2s	295.2	 but how many of those, those Reddit kids, uh, saw it as a problem when, you know, Trump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=300.5s	300.5	 or his supporters got, or parlor got deplatformed a few weeks ago, they could never have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=305.0s	305.0	 massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=308.3s	308.3	 um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=329.7s	329.7	 relation to that, how delightful has it been to not have Trump on Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=336.2s	336.2	 putting aside, you know, censorship, even for you as a Republican, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=342.2s	342.2	 conservative, but liberal socially, I will note, uh, you're very liberal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=346.2s	346.2	 socially, you're live and let live, uh, pro LBGTQ of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=351.4s	351.4	 Uh, and, but to not have Trump on Twitter has been all that cognitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=356.3s	356.3	 space has come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=357.3s	357.3	 We get it all back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=358.8s	358.8	 So silence is, is, is bliss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=362.7s	362.7	 Uh, what did you guys think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=363.6s	363.6	 What did you guys think about, um, what is her name?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=366.6s	366.6	 Marjorie, blah, blah, blah, green, who just got completely censored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=371.2s	371.2	 What, what exactly happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=373.3s	373.3	 Yes, sex is that censorship?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=376.0s	376.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=376.2s	376.2	 If you're a crazy loon who believes that was a false flag, what do we do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=382.5s	382.5	 They know that's not, that's not censorship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=384.8s	384.8	 It's just, she got censored, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=386.9s	386.9	 Um, because her colleagues thought she was out of line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=390.2s	390.2	 That's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=391.0s	391.0	 I mean, if her colleagues want to vote for that, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=393.8s	393.8	 So she can still say crazy stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=395.9s	395.9	 She just can't do it and have this certain job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=398.0s	398.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=398.3s	398.3	 I mean, look, let's face it when, when politicians say crazy stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=402.1s	402.1	 it helps the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=403.6s	403.6	 I mean, you know, Marjorie green or whatever her censorship, who does that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=407.2s	407.2	 help it helps the Democrats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=408.6s	408.6	 Um, you know, quite frankly, uh, does Trump being off Twitter, uh, does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=414.5s	414.5	 that really help Democrats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=416.7s	416.7	 I don't think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=417.4s	417.4	 I mean, um, you know, you could argue that that Biden or that Trump is the one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=423.0s	423.0	 unifying opposition to Trump is the one unifying force in the democratic coalition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=428.7s	428.7	 So the, the, the, the more Trump is out there, the more it bonds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=432.4s	432.4	 the democratic coalition together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=434.4s	434.4	 Um, so yeah, I mean, censorship has this way of like backfiring and, uh, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=440.4s	440.4	 can't just look at it in terms of narrow short-term political results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=443.6s	443.6	 Speaking of censorship, I want to get your take on something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=445.9s	445.9	 I think these last two weeks have been a complete sea change in venture capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=451.7s	451.7	 And let me give you the setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=453.5s	453.5	 It's all of a sudden seemed like, um, there's been a decision that's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=459.3s	459.3	 made where the ecosystem of companies will basically use their own platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=467.4s	467.4	 and their own mediums to completely control the narrative and the dissemination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=471.2s	471.2	 of information about them, that the media in the effort of company building,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=476.6s	476.6	 um, may have taken a big step back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=478.7s	478.7	 Um, you know, I think, uh, the whole sort of like thing on clubhouse was really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=485.1s	485.1	 interesting, I think, uh, this guy who just joined Andreessen Horowitz, um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=489.7s	489.7	 who actually hosts a show on clubhouse is really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=492.9s	492.9	 Um, I think there's some like really interesting emerging managers who just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=497.1s	497.1	 have these incredibly different ways of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=499.0s	499.0	 Shreeram is his name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=500.4s	500.4	 Um, he's been hosting good times at 11, 10 or 11 PM every night on clubhouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=505.5s	505.5	 Mark Andreessen comes to it every night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=506.9s	506.9	 And of course, Elon came interviewed Vlad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=509.4s	509.4	 And then last night Zuckerberg showed up, uh, in order to get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=513.3s	513.3	 blueprints for clubhouse to then put it into Instagram and Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=518.1s	518.1	 But what do you guys, what do you guys think of sort of like this entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=520.9s	520.9	 sector of the economy, basically trying to, I guess, organize an end around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=525.8s	525.8	 traditional media?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=526.8s	526.8	 It doesn't seem like it's just venture, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=528.7s	528.7	 I mean, look at, look at Trump, you know, he avoided having the traditional press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=532.7s	532.7	 conference as the channel for dissemination of his point of view and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=536.5s	536.5	 communication of his, uh, objectives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=539.6s	539.6	 And he went on Twitter every day and he just tweeted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=542.5s	542.5	 Um, and I think, you know, anyone who's been part of a business or an operation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=547.0s	547.0	 that's had to deal with, you know, media gathering facts that, uh, that you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=552.5s	552.5	 consider to be true and you can't really counter their point and then they publish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=555.9s	555.9	 and it's static and it's out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=557.9s	557.9	 Um, you're frustrated and in the, in the world that we have today, which is many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=562.1s	562.1	 alternatives for going direct to our customer and going direct to our audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=565.9s	565.9	 through social media and having control over that message, uh, it's appealing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=569.8s	569.8	 make the switch away from traditional PR and going to social.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=573.7s	573.7	 I mean, Chamath, you don't put out press releases, you go on Twitter and you make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=576.7s	576.7	 a statement about what your intentions are and you publish your one-pagers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=579.7s	579.7	 And I feel like everyone's trying to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=581.5s	581.5	 And there's all this like trend of big companies now too, which is how do you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=584.3s	584.3	 develop a quote unquote social media presence?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=586.8s	586.8	 You can speak directly to your audience and your customers without having to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=589.3s	589.3	 go through the press.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=590.5s	590.5	 I find it very hard, um, to get the point across, um, by going through traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=597.7s	597.7	 media, it's not that it's not that it can't be done, but I find it harder and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=601.6s	601.6	 harder and the reason is because they're in such a ferocious competition with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=605.3s	605.3	 social media and so they have to be just as click oriented and newsworthy, um, as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=611.3s	611.3	 the next best tweet that's, that's trending at that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=613.6s	613.6	 So it's, it's an almost impossible task.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=615.7s	615.7	 Well, Naval, Naval had a great line about this, which I think he tweeted a long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=618.9s	618.9	 time ago, which is that the internet commoditized the reporting of facts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=623.0s	623.0	 And so at that point, the traditional media went wholesale into opinions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=628.3s	628.3	 into opinions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=629.5s	629.5	 And so now they all have an agenda of some kind, and especially the tech press,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=634.9s	634.9	 their agenda basically is hatred of tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=638.3s	638.3	 I mean, they hate the people they're reporting on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=640.6s	640.6	 I mean, Jay Cal, you know this, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=642.1s	642.1	 I mean, yeah, I mean, having been a journalist in this, it's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=645.0s	645.0	 interesting to hear your opinions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=646.5s	646.5	 And if you look at trust among, uh, Republicans all time low, uh, in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=654.3s	654.3	 press, and then just all Americans don't trust the press right now, they think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=657.5s	657.5	 there's hidden agendas and it really is a confluence of events.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=661.3s	661.3	 What happened was the internet caused, um, the revenue streams of the press
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=667.2s	667.2	 to get just violently compressed or eliminated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=670.3s	670.3	 So, you know, you had Craigslist take the classified business, Google and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=673.8s	673.8	 Facebook took the ad business in subscriptions, Netflix, Spotify, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=678.5s	678.5	 So you have all that revenue is gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=681.0s	681.0	 And what that meant was they, uh, didn't have the resources to do fact checking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=686.8s	686.8	 And then the publishing schedule, because of blogging, which I was involved in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=691.0s	691.0	 required that people file two, three, four times a day just to keep up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=695.6s	695.6	 And so when you're filing, even just twice a day, there is no time to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=699.5s	699.5	 get quotes from the subjects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=701.6s	701.6	 So we have all, as people who are subjects had quotes, uh, attributed to us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=706.9s	706.9	 that were like, where did you pull that quote from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=708.7s	708.7	 Like, oh, three years ago, you said this or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=710.8s	710.8	 And then you don't even know you're going to be in the story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=712.7s	712.7	 Like the hit piece they did on you Chamath, some sports writer and SF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=716.7s	716.7	 gate did some hit piece on Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=718.9s	718.9	 Did they ever call you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=720.3s	720.3	 Did they ever say, would you like to respond to this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=722.3s	722.3	 That's how it used to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=723.6s	723.6	 That's what you, that's what you learn when you get a degree in journalism, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=726.3s	726.3	 You call the subject, you interview, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=727.9s	727.9	 And it used to be, you filed once every two weeks, or maybe if you were in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=731.9s	731.9	 weekly news, a news, like a news week or a business week, you filed once a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=737.0s	737.0	 Magazines you filed once or twice per episode per issue, or maybe once every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=742.0s	742.0	 other issue or feature writer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=743.7s	743.7	 Now they have to, they have to publish so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=746.0s	746.0	 By the way, Jason, you said something, any fact checking, you said something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=749.1s	749.1	 really, really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=750.6s	750.6	 It's the craziest thing where these guys will not even call you and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=755.1s	755.1	 here's what we're running or here's what we're going to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=758.1s	758.1	 Do you want to work through this with us?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=759.9s	759.9	 Do you want to tell us, are there any inaccuracies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=762.2s	762.2	 We're really seeking the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=764.0s	764.0	 Nobody's really seeking the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=765.3s	765.3	 They're seeking clicks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=766.8s	766.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=767.0s	767.0	 And so here's what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=768.7s	768.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=768.9s	768.9	 The, your salary is now determined by your number of followers on Twitter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=774.0s	774.0	 as is your book deal and your sub stack then becomes your negotiating position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=778.9s	778.9	 versus your existing publication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=781.2s	781.2	 So someone like Kara Swishers, who is not full time at the New York Times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=784.4s	784.4	 probably makes a half million or a million dollars a year doing her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=786.7s	786.7	 podcast with them in the editorial page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=788.2s	788.2	 I would say somewhere between 500K and a million.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=790.7s	790.7	 All the other writers there are looking at other people who've gotten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=794.8s	794.8	 significant followings and saying, I have to get a big following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=797.6s	797.6	 How do you get a big following?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=798.8s	798.8	 Well, Saks figured that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=800.9s	800.9	 He, he wasn't, didn't have a huge following on Twitter in the last couple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=803.7s	803.7	 of months, but since we did the podcast, Saks started having an opinion and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=806.3s	806.3	 picking a side and really owning his opinion and what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=810.0s	810.0	 But in fairness, and also being super and super intelligent and thoughtful about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=813.7s	813.7	 Of course, but anybody picking a side gets rewarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=818.2s	818.2	 And if you go down the middle, you don't get rewarded because people go, that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=822.4s	822.4	 But then I think that people, then people should just be using facts as a jumping off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=826.3s	826.3	 point, as opposed to like weaving it into the narrative so that other folks get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=829.4s	829.4	 confused, meaning, you know, it used to be the case that a newspaper has an opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=833.7s	833.7	 page. Well, no, now the whole newspaper is opinions, correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=836.9s	836.9	 Because the facts you can just get from the AP, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=839.7s	839.7	 Like there's, there's no point calling the New York Times to figure out what the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=842.4s	842.4	 hell is going on in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=843.2s	843.2	 Really what they should be doing is deep analysis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=845.6s	845.6	 Yeah, like the New York Times article that you brought up a couple of weeks ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=848.4s	848.4	 Chamath, that we talked about on the pod was about the, the, the trust fund kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=853.4s	853.4	 who are giving away all their money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=855.3s	855.3	 You know, it wasn't an analysis of how many people with this amount of wealth are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=859.8s	859.8	 giving away their money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=860.7s	860.7	 It was anecdotes to make the case that this is the storyline that they kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=864.5s	864.5	 wanted to progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=866.3s	866.3	 And, you know, that is, I think the, where you're able to kind of stay within the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=869.6s	869.6	 bounds of traditional journalism, but still, you know, get a narrative across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=873.8s	873.8	 that is a bit sensational and it is a bit kind of, you know, inspiring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=877.2s	877.2	 And Friedberg, all you need to do, having been on the inside of these discussions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=881.0s	881.0	 is when you have one person, it's a profile as an example, when you have two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=886.5s	886.5	 it's still a kind of a profile with an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=888.5s	888.5	 But once you get to three, you got a trend piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=891.0s	891.0	 And so your, and your say to you is if you can get me a third person who's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=894.7s	894.7	 trust fund kid, now we got a trend piece and we're in the clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=897.0s	897.0	 So let's do that and do the anecdotes instead of actual research, which then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=900.7s	900.7	 takes time and resources.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=902.8s	902.8	 And if you look what Andreessen Horowitz has specifically done with Clubhouse is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=906.9s	906.9	 and it's really freaked out some New York Times reporters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=909.3s	909.3	 I won't say which ones, because every time I mentioned this one reporter, she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=912.9s	912.9	 pulls the female reporter card and she pulled it last night where she said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=917.5s	917.5	 I'm a female reporter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=918.5s	918.5	 Taylor Lawrence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=919.1s	919.1	 Mark Andreessen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=920.6s	920.6	 I'm not going to say who it is because she gets really upset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=922.9s	922.9	 It's Taylor Lawrence, but she, I mean, she, yeah, she tweeted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=925.7s	925.7	 So I don't think she's hiding from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=929.9s	929.9	 Now bringing up her name, she will, I guarantee you tweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=933.7s	933.7	 Well, can I say something about being harassed by Jason Calacanis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=936.6s	936.6	 Cause I'm a woman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=937.6s	937.6	 She's saying that Mark Andreessen and Andreessen Horowitz blocked her from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=942.4s	942.4	 their Clubhouse room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=943.2s	943.2	 When you're blocked from a Clubhouse room, you don't get access.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=945.1s	945.1	 So she said, I'm going to make my own shadow account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=947.5s	947.5	 She did make a puppet account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=949.4s	949.4	 Now she's listening in and she got upset at me because I told people in a room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=952.9s	952.9	 Hey, there's a New York Times report in the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=954.3s	954.3	 Just be careful because this could wind up in print.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=956.4s	956.4	 She called that harassment and gender-based harassment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=959.6s	959.6	 And the thing they're complaining about now is that all of us are trying to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=964.5s	964.5	 around them and just tell our stories directly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=967.0s	967.0	 And so they're all in rage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=968.3s	968.3	 They're saying, how dare Mark Andreessen or, you know, a 16 Z, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=972.9s	972.9	 know, not talk to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=974.7s	974.7	 It's like, well, why should they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=976.3s	976.3	 I mean, you know, my experience with the press has been that about 75% of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=980.9s	980.9	 time when they asked me for comment on something, it ends up being a hit piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=985.1s	985.1	 Maybe not on me, but on some something I care about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=988.6s	988.6	 And they, they, they twist what you say or take one little quote out of context
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=992.7s	992.7	 to support the article.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=993.7s	993.7	 And you end up giving credence to an article that you completely disagree with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=997.8s	997.8	 And so, and so all of us have to stop taking those calls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1001.3s	1001.3	 I mean, we just know, we just know there's such an agenda behind most of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1007.1s	1007.1	 calls that we just like, don't take them anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1009.8s	1009.8	 That's, that's why we're going direct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1011.8s	1011.8	 I'll say one thing about Taylor Lawrence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1013.2s	1013.2	 I I've learned a lot because I feel like, you know, being 44, I'm kind of out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1018.3s	1018.3	 no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1018.6s	1018.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1019.1s	1019.1	 And I've learned a lot because she is, she has her finger on the process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1022.6s	1022.6	 I mean, it's really, it's been really fun reading her, reading her stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1026.8s	1026.8	 The other thing I'll say is on the Andreessen thing, I think what they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1030.1s	1030.1	 finally stumbled into, like I remember when, you know, Andreessen started about a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1033.9s	1033.9	 year before I started social capital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1036.5s	1036.5	 And I remember the whole push was, you know, multi-services, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1040.1s	1040.1	 And they were going to be recruiting and sales and this and that, you know, I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1044.1s	1044.1	 suspect that all of that was kind of like pretty meager ROI and not that it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1048.5s	1048.5	 burned a ton of fees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1050.4s	1050.4	 But I think this thing that they're doing is really smart because if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1053.9s	1053.9	 effectively build their own distribution arm through newsletters, sub stack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1059.0s	1059.0	 podcasts, you know, clubhouse shows, whatever, that's a force to be reckoned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1063.8s	1063.8	 with because then if you're a venture investor, you either have to be like them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1068.7s	1068.7	 with their own version, in which case the brand event Andreessen really matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1073.9s	1073.9	 Or you're on this path of where the trend of venture is already going, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1077.9s	1077.9	 solo GPS and individual people are the brands and there's going to be very little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1082.8s	1082.8	 space in the middle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1083.5s	1083.5	 So for example, like I do think that like, you know, the all in podcasts helps,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1087.7s	1087.7	 for example, David in craft or Jason, you and launch, but you guys, it is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1092.8s	1092.8	 crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1093.5s	1093.5	 But then you guys also stand alone as individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1096.5s	1096.5	 But, you know, if you're a traditional firm, you know, pick your organization,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1099.7s	1099.7	 which neither has brands nor has distribution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1103.7s	1103.7	 What are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1104.9s	1104.9	 You're probably forced to just pay the highest price.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1106.9s	1106.9	 And so those returns for those folks in the middle get really bad, I think over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 time and you at some point have to decide, are you an individual person?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1116.3s	1116.3	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1116.6s	1116.6	 And there's like some amazing up and coming GPS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1118.7s	1118.7	 We know them, Locky Groom, folks like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1121.2s	1121.2	 Or are you, are you Andreessen Horowitz with this massive distribution?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1125.5s	1125.5	 I mean, and now we have to just, I think, face the reality that we are in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1130.1s	1130.1	 competition and I think that's what is making the press even more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1135.9s	1135.9	 That's what makes a situation even more complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1137.7s	1137.7	 I'm not saying the press is targeting people they consider competitive, but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1141.3s	1141.3	 press is not getting Vlad, Elon or Zuck for interviews, but because Mark Andreessen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1147.5s	1147.5	 has, you know, Clubhouse now they put themselves on the suggested follower list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1152.5s	1152.5	 Just like Twitter put Ohm, Kara Swisher and some other journalists on the suggested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 followers for Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1158.5s	1158.5	 What that was, was it was payment basically like a million followers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1161.8s	1161.8	 Now Andreessen has a million followers, Balaji, all these folks from Andreessen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1165.5s	1165.5	 I believe have like a million followers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1167.1s	1167.1	 So the press is complaining about that as well, because they can then dominate them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1171.9s	1171.9	 in terms of getting subjects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1173.1s	1173.1	 So they've lost the subjects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1174.3s	1174.3	 None of us get on the phone with the press with very few exceptions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1177.6s	1177.6	 And where is Sway or Vox or Ezra Klein when compared to our podcast, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1183.7s	1183.7	 Like we're right up there with them, if not ahead of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1186.6s	1186.6	 I mean, we're the number one tech podcast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1187.9s	1187.9	 So it's, it's pretty crazy when you think about how much their world has changed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1193.2s	1193.2	 And now they're directly in competition with Andreessen Horowitz, all in podcast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1197.3s	1197.3	 you know, pick the firm doing a venture thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1199.0s	1199.0	 And that's going to make this even more contentious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1201.3s	1201.3	 I, yes, I totally agree with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1203.6s	1203.6	 But I also, I do think fundamentally that all of us wouldn't have felt the same need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1208.4s	1208.4	 to go around them if we didn't feel that there was such a strong agenda.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1212.5s	1212.5	 Just to bring what have you guys heard of gel man amnesia effect?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1216.2s	1216.2	 Michael Crichton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1217.0s	1217.0	 OK, so Michael Crichton, you know, who wrote Dress at Park and like a true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1221.6s	1221.6	 polymath and genius, right? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1223.5s	1223.5	 Airframe very good, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1225.1s	1225.1	 I mean, so many brilliant things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 He was even a Hollywood director, true multi-talented guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1231.5s	1231.5	 Anyway, he described the gel man amnesia effect as follows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1234.6s	1234.6	 He says, you open the newspaper to an article on some subject, you know, well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1238.7s	1238.7	 So in this case, it was a physics paper by on gel man. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1244.6s	1244.6	 He says, you know this. Yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1246.1s	1246.1	 He says, he says, you read the article and see the journalist has absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1249.8s	1249.8	 no understanding of either the facts or the issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1254.0s	1254.0	 Often the article is so wrong and actually presents the story backwards,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1257.1s	1257.1	 reversing cause and effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1258.4s	1258.4	 I call these the wet streets cause rain stories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1261.4s	1261.4	 The paper is full of them. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1263.2s	1263.2	 In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1265.9s	1265.9	 the multiple errors in a story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1268.4s	1268.4	 But then you turn the page to some other section to national
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1271.7s	1271.7	 international affairs and you read the rest of the paper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1274.5s	1274.5	 as if it was somehow more accurate. Totally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1278.4s	1278.4	 You turn the page and forget what you know, which is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1283.5s	1283.5	 the journalists get so much wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1285.8s	1285.8	 And and I think, you know, and all of us kind of suffer from gel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1289.2s	1289.2	 man amnesia sometimes because we still, I think, take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1292.3s	1292.3	 when we read something in the paper, we take it at face value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1295.9s	1295.9	 And I think but we all know that when it comes to tech reporting or whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1299.3s	1299.3	 there's so much misinformation that gets put out by these official channels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1304.5s	1304.5	 And I think at the end of the day, what's happening now with these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1307.2s	1307.2	 and run around the traditional media, it's all a response to gel man amnesia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1312.3s	1312.3	 I think it's a problem of complexity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1315.0s	1315.0	 You know, I remember years ago, I would when I was younger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1317.6s	1317.6	 I would read the paper or read magazines about science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1321.9s	1321.9	 and engineering, and I was, you know, really interested in these topics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1325.8s	1325.8	 And it was only years later when I actually realized how wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1328.5s	1328.5	 so many of those articles were as I started to read the original scientific
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1331.7s	1331.7	 research papers. But it takes a skill set and it takes a significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1336.1s	1336.1	 amount more time to really go into depth into those papers and to actually read them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1340.3s	1340.3	 The same is true, as you point out, with like, you know, geopolitical issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1343.9s	1343.9	 like the complexity of what goes on. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1347.1s	1347.1	 Here's what I learned when I was a journalist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1349.5s	1349.5	 We would have about 10 to 20 percent of the information about what occurred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1354.3s	1354.3	 when we published our first story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1356.1s	1356.1	 And then maybe every subsequent follow up, we get another 10 percent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1359.9s	1359.9	 which means if we were really hooked into a story and we did five versions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1363.7s	1363.7	 of that story, we might get to 40 percent, 50 percent understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1368.4s	1368.4	 Whereas when the four of us are doing a deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1371.2s	1371.2	 and then you see this impact, you know, the press is getting it completely wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1375.3s	1375.3	 And that was fine if you felt the press was fair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1380.4s	1380.4	 Right. But that's what's happening is now there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1382.4s	1382.4	 There's a distinct feeling with subjects that they're being treated unfairly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1385.7s	1385.7	 And what I do when somebody connects to me and they say, hey, can you comment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1388.9s	1388.9	 on Robin or whatever? I said, I can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1390.8s	1390.8	 But I do have a great story for you about a world positive startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1394.1s	1394.1	 And I kept doing this with Teddy, who kept asking me to give information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1396.9s	1396.9	 on friends of mine, you know, the guy from Ricoh to whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1400.6s	1400.6	 who covers like philanthropy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1402.4s	1402.4	 And every time they contact me, I say, yeah, you know, I can't comment on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1405.4s	1405.4	 But you can talk to the founder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1406.5s	1406.5	 But I have three world positive stories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1408.1s	1408.1	 Are you interested in any of them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1409.0s	1409.0	 And I just do that kind of to troll them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1410.7s	1410.7	 And they've never in five years taken me up on profiling a world positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1416.0s	1416.0	 So if the press wants to turn this around, a very simple solution is one for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1420.5s	1420.5	 One of your hate stories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1421.9s	1421.9	 So if you for every time you want to take down a company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1424.9s	1424.9	 maybe write about one company that's doing something good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1427.3s	1427.3	 There's some company doing something in carbon sequestering right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1430.4s	1430.4	 That is super valid and world positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1432.5s	1432.5	 Write about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1433.4s	1433.4	 And the only time they write about Tesla is when Elon trips or,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1436.4s	1436.4	 you know, something somebody dies in a car or they write about Uber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1439.7s	1439.7	 because of some tragedy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1440.7s	1440.7	 Sorry, I just want to say like Jason, like just going back a second, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1443.6s	1443.6	 your point is one about bias, which is, you know, creating sensationalism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1447.1s	1447.1	 sell stories, it's what consumers want to consume at the end of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1450.7s	1450.7	 So there's certainly, you know, a market driven model there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1454.0s	1454.0	 The point I was trying to make earlier is there's also a separate problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1456.3s	1456.3	 around complexity, which is complex issues take time and take depth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1459.8s	1459.8	 to truly understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1461.1s	1461.1	 And so to really understand what's going on in the Middle East
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1463.4s	1463.4	 or what's going on inside of a company like Facebook requires more than a five
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1467.2s	1467.2	 paragraph journal article, it requires some hours of conversation and dialogue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1471.6s	1471.6	 And I think, by the way, the craving for that depth, which delivers truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1475.8s	1475.8	 and understanding is what, you know, podcasts can provide and clubhouse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1478.8s	1478.8	 is providing long form content that allows you to go into the nuance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1484.0s	1484.0	 and into the texture and into the depth of what's going on in the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1486.8s	1486.8	 as opposed to having the five paragraph littered with ads, BuzzFeed article
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1491.9s	1491.9	 that says something sensational, but it simplifies something to the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1494.8s	1494.8	 that it's often wrong or completely misses the real depth of what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1499.1s	1499.1	 And, you know, it's like, and I think that I think they're both,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1501.6s	1501.6	 they're both, they're both kind of playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1502.8s	1502.8	 And then I want to give a prediction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1504.2s	1504.2	 The they're both what you're describing are both issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1506.9s	1506.9	 And I think they're related in the following sense that if you were to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1510.4s	1510.4	 to like any of these reporters, like the people that Jake, I'll mention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1513.4s	1513.4	 a couple of names, OK, if you were to filter their bylines,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1517.0s	1517.0	 and see all of their not one story, but look at like all of the headlines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1521.6s	1521.6	 for all their stories over, say, the past year, you will definitely see a trend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1525.8s	1525.8	 They will all, they will all have, you know, like negative for certain reporters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1531.5s	1531.5	 It'll be a hundred percent negative about tech, zero percent positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1534.7s	1534.7	 Aaron Griffin, I think, is the reporter who's one of the top tech reporters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1538.3s	1538.3	 at the New York Times. It's just like Coinbase, Coinbase away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1541.4s	1541.4	 Exactly. So when's the last time they wrote a positive story?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1543.4s	1543.4	 So there is this huge agenda there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1546.0s	1546.0	 And and I think it prevents people from getting into the complexity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1550.2s	1550.2	 because it's a lot easier to write, you know, the prediction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1553.0s	1553.0	 And then to make a bold prediction here, the media companies are going to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1556.3s	1556.3	 you know, they're obviously picking aside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1557.6s	1557.6	 They obviously went subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1558.9s	1558.9	 Now they're dealing with Substack, Clubhouse, podcasts, all chipping away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1563.8s	1563.8	 I think what's going to happen is you're going to see media brands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1567.1s	1567.1	 built around certain podcasts and they're going to work subject first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1571.6s	1571.6	 In other words, the subject of the story are going to create media property.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1575.7s	1575.7	 So if you look at what we've done with All-In, and obviously I have this week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1578.1s	1578.1	 in startups, if we did the Friedberg on science podcast and it was just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1583.2s	1583.2	 Friedberg explaining a science topic and then then we did Chamath on public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1586.6s	1586.6	 markets and then we did Sachs on, you know, alt-right conspiracy theories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1591.2s	1591.2	 And we just had five pods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1594.9s	1594.9	 Or it could be something else. I don't know, guns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1597.4s	1597.4	 You know, pro-life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1601.9s	1601.9	 I don't know what Sachs is into, but you know, but no Sachs could do something on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1605.5s	1605.5	 Sachs. So Sachs on Sachs, Friedberg on science, Chamath on thirst traps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1612.6s	1612.6	 Then we have All-In.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1614.0s	1614.0	 That's five, five full pods of an hour and a half each.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1617.7s	1617.7	 If each of you did your own pod and I have my pod and we made the All-In network,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1621.5s	1621.5	 the All-In news network, I guarantee you we would be within five years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1626.8s	1626.8	 you know, right up there with CNN and MSN Music.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1629.0s	1629.0	 Well, one thing that Jason and I've been doing with now is I really do want to start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1634.4s	1634.4	 a Twitch channel. And I think part of why is I'd like to really actually have more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1640.8s	1640.8	 conversations about, you know, companies and stocks and-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1644.5s	1644.5	 With youth, with the youths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1646.3s	1646.3	 Yeah, with the youths and like, you know, really get into the details and like also when we,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1651.3s	1651.3	 you know, partner with a company, bring them on the show so that we can spend an hour or two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1656.0s	1656.0	 and talk about things in detail, it's totally lost. And the crazy thing that I realized for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1662.8s	1662.8	 is, you know, to your point, Jason, like, you know, we have enough distribution now where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1667.3s	1667.3	 millions of people can see it. And that has real impact because, you know, you can allow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1671.9s	1671.9	 people to judge. And I'm not necessarily saying we're better or worse than anybody else, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1675.8s	1675.8	 if we're not using it for the express purpose of selling ads necessarily and getting paid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1681.9s	1681.9	 I do think there's a better likelihood that the outcome is better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1685.3s	1685.3	 Well, I mean, a big part of the success of this has been the banning of guests and the banning of-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1689.5s	1689.5	 Banning of ads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1690.6s	1690.6	 And banning of ads, people really have responded to that. And I think if we put the Twitch channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1694.1s	1694.1	 up and we just throw in all in, throw in this week in startups, and then, you know, a Sachs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1699.6s	1699.6	 you know, point counterpoint show, and I'm being sincere, Friedberg, just Friedberg on science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1705.5s	1705.5	 And, you know, that's five shows. And we just say every Friday, there's going to be five shows,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1709.4s	1709.4	 like this is your weekend, and we're going to loop it and there'll be a Q&A. I guarantee you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1713.5s	1713.5	 we could get five other besties to do shows, you know, and we would-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1718.4s	1718.4	 Didn't you guys originally, like, so for the audience that doesn't know this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1724.8s	1724.8	 originally the all in podcast was Chamath and Jason. They were talking about doing a show together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1731.3s	1731.3	 And then COVID hit and they, I think you guys asked me on the pod zero to talk about COVID stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1737.3s	1737.3	 But what was the original goal you guys had, you know, Chamath, isn't that what you wanted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1741.7s	1741.7	 to do originally was to have kind of a direct audience and a direct conversation about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1745.4s	1745.4	 you know, whatever it is you wanted to talk about, where you could have this kind of long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1748.3s	1748.3	 form dialogue. You know, what did you guys, why did you guys want to do it in the first place?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1752.7s	1752.7	 I mean, wasn't that kind of the idea? I'll tell you what, what sort of like my general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1756.6s	1756.6	 viewpoint is, which is that, like, we are atomizing our affinity. So I think that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1765.3s	1765.3	 like, we've gone from believing in institutions, and now I think we fundamentally mistrust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1770.5s	1770.5	 institutions. Then we spent 30 or 40 years believing in companies. And now I think we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1775.9s	1775.9	 basically don't believe in companies anymore. And now we're sort of at the, at the, at the bleeding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1780.9s	1780.9	 edge of what, where belief and trust exists, which is at an individual person level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1786.3s	1786.3	 Ownership.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1788.7s	1788.7	 So, so like, you know, I, and I think that when an individual has the potential to not just be about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1796.4s	1796.4	 something for themselves, but also for themes that other people care about, that's when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1801.0s	1801.0	 get real heat. And obviously the most impressive example of that is Elon, because, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1805.5s	1805.5	 he represents exploration, engineering, science, climate change, you know, memes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1811.6s	1811.6	 all of this stuff. Not really, not really. These other things are really what matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1817.5s	1817.5	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1818.6s	1818.6	 And so, and so what it shows people is like, I just want to find affinity around a few key people. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1823.9s	1823.9	 what he is, is not the end state. He's the beginning of the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1828.3s	1828.3	 Right. So what's going to happen is all of us will say, I don't trust institutions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1833.2s	1833.2	 So whatever they put out is just going to be Corpo. I don't trust companies. What they say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1837.6s	1837.6	 is going to be Corpo. I'm going to take my best shot at finding folks that I think are real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1844.3s	1844.3	 And I'm just going to get that. That's the thing. That's why I wanted to do this with Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1848.9s	1848.9	 And then with the four of us, I think what happened almost accidentally is it's like a real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1855.7s	1855.7	 plurality of views. And you don't have to agree with all of us. And frankly, nobody does. And we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1862.9s	1862.9	 don't generally agree 100%. But I think that's what's happening. So I think we're another much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1868.5s	1868.5	 smaller than Elon, but another example of you're going to want to find your own truth tellers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1875.1s	1875.1	 folks that you will get behind. And I think that business people, that's where they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1880.2s	1880.2	 going to emerge. Because if you look at that first generation of star, Kim Kardashian,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1884.2s	1884.2	 the Kanye West of the world, that's arcing. Then people went to the Mr. Beasts, and that's still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1890.3s	1890.3	 building. So you have the business celebrity building, you have next generation celebrity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1896.3s	1896.3	 building. And I think that's where it's going to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1898.0s	1898.0	 Let me just ask you guys one question. Because I think the intention with journalists was to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1904.3s	1904.3	 arbiters of the truth or discover as a fact and to deliver that fact to their audience. And when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1911.3s	1911.3	 you have this direct relationship between the source and the audience, as you do through social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1916.9s	1916.9	 media and Twitter and whatnot, there isn't an arbiter, there isn't a third party. And everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1922.9s	1922.9	 that then is said by the source is taken at face value. How does that play out in a world where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1928.7s	1928.7	 Trump may say things like, hey, there's election fraud, when the facts don't line up, and now you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1934.3s	1934.3	 have this ability to not have an arbiter. And these people, anyone that now has a direct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1938.9s	1938.9	 relationship with a large audience can say anything they want, and drive large change without those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1944.3s	1944.3	 things necessarily being rooted in some relative objective sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1949.4s	1949.4	 So, Sax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1950.4s	1950.4	 Well, I mean, I think it's a marketplace of ideas and everybody's competing. And the answer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1956.6s	1956.6	 bad speech or bad ideas is more speech and better ideas. And I mean, that's the reality is it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1962.7s	1962.7	 very frustrating to see people propagating things that aren't true. However, none of us has a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1968.7s	1968.7	 monopoly on the truth. We can't say for sure what it is. And so we arrive at the truth through sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1973.1s	1973.1	 of a free marketplace of ideas. There is no better solution than that. There is no magical way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1980.3s	1980.3	 entrust a small elite of people with the right to censor and tell us what the truth is without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1988.4s	1988.4	 essentially creating a worse situation. And that's the fundamental problem. So yeah, look, we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=1995.7s	1995.7	 going to we're going to this era in which there is no, if you go back like 50 years ago, you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2004.2s	2004.2	 Walter Cronkite saying, and that's the way it is, and everyone believed him. And then the New York
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2007.7s	2007.7	 Times was the paper of record and people believe that. That's fit to print. Right, exactly. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2012.5s	2012.5	 but that's been steadily eroding for decades. And now the internet is the final erosion of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2018.3s	2018.3	 And, and look, I think it's not an alt, it's not a bad thing. Because in order for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2025.3s	2025.3	 journalism to work, you need all the journalists to buy into a certain code of journalistic behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2031.5s	2031.5	 and ethics, which is all about objectivity. And the press doesn't buy into that anymore. They don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2036.4s	2036.4	 believe in objectivity anymore. No, especially something sacks young writers I found.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2043.9s	2043.9	 When we were trying to hire young writers for insight, as an example, they all wanted to write
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2048.4s	2048.4	 anti Trump, you know, pro woke, whatever they had some acts to grind. And I said, you know, you should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2054.2s	2054.2	 really write for an opinion page, but you haven't done any journalism yet. So you should probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2057.2s	2057.2	 do journalism for 10 years. And then the second decade, you earn the right to be on the opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2061.5s	2061.5	 page. Let's put in some reps do 10 years of this. And, you know, it just never actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2070.0s	2070.0	 do you guys hear something? You guys see that movie from from dusk till dawn, and there's that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2075.1s	2075.1	 moment where the movie just suddenly the scene changes and everything's different. What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2080.6s	2080.6	 What's going on? That's the we have a line. Wait, what? Somebody's calling the bestie phone. Did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2086.3s	2086.3	 you give the bestie phone number to somebody? Oh, my God, is somebody? Wait, what's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2091.3s	2091.3	 Who's there? You up? You up? You what's going on? Okay, let's see. Is anybody there? Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2099.9s	2099.9	 Whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2106.6s	2106.6	 Draymond Green in the house. What's up, bestie?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2109.5s	2109.5	 Bestie? What's going on? What's up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2113.6s	2113.6	 Where are you? Are you in a are you in a coronavirus COVID quarantine somewhere in an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2120.2s	2120.2	 NBA bubble? Where are you? I am. I'm in I'm in Dallas stuck in the hotel with bad water pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2127.5s	2127.5	 The worst. That honestly, that is the thing. If you had to give me the most luxurious hotel in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2133.2s	2133.2	 the world, but with a tap a faucet for water pressure. No, thanks. I would rather sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2138.2s	2138.2	 I would rather sleep in a box with a great with a great shower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2142.1s	2142.1	 The water pressure is everything. Everything. All right. On the call, obviously drafted by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2148.3s	2148.3	 the Golden State Warriors in the second round, 35th overall in the 2020 NBA draft three time NBA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2154.3s	2154.3	 champion 2016-17 defensive player of the year, two time NBA All-Star, five time all defense,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2161.5s	2161.5	 and drafted behind Michael Kidd, Gil Chris, D.L. Mortars, Harrison Barnes, Tyler Zellner,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2167.6s	2167.6	 Miles Plumby. And I don't know how many people got drafted ahead of you, Draymond, but I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2173.3s	2173.3	 that you can repeat them in order. Is there anybody who's drafted ahead of you who has achieved even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2177.9s	2177.9	 a fraction of what you've achieved in the NBA, Draymond? There's 34 guys drafted ahead of me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2182.8s	2182.8	 and I definitely can still name all of them. And saying that, I think there are a few.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2189.3s	2189.3	 Anthony Davis. He's done okay. He got one ring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2192.7s	2192.7	 Daniel Miller. No rings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2197.5s	2197.5	 But a stud. Very good player, but no rings. I'm just saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2202.0s	2202.0	 And Bradley Beal. Brad Beal. Okay. Also no rings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2207.2s	2207.2	 I got all the guys in the rings category, but then I don't have Patrick McCall in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2211.1s	2211.1	 rings category. Patrick McCall has the same amount of rings as me. So who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2214.5s	2214.5	 Oh, respect to those guys. I know they don't have the rings. I got major respect for those guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2225.8s	2225.8	 We were thinking about what to talk to you about coming on the pod. And we have a series of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2231.7s	2231.7	 questions just about being an NBA player and what you've learned and how good you've become. I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2237.5s	2237.5	 I'll start it off with one question, which is, it seems like every year you get a little better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2241.3s	2241.3	 at something. How do you do that? Do you like say over the summer, I'm just going to be better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2246.7s	2246.7	 at my screens. I'm going to be better at X, Y or Z. Or do you just try to get incrementally better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2251.9s	2251.9	 all year long? I mean, you always want to try to get better all year long. But the reality is with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2257.5s	2257.5	 this season, with the way, not just this season in particular, an NBA season in general, you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2263.9s	2263.9	 have much time to get better. So your college is getting better on the fly. And when you're in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2269.2s	2269.2	 your workouts during the season, you're just trying to maintain because there's such little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2273.2s	2273.2	 prep time. But during the off season, you really lock in on a couple of things and try to get better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2278.3s	2278.3	 at those things. And I think I've become a much better ball handler. I think I see the floor much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2283.3s	2283.3	 better. I think I've gotten better overall as a player. The one area that I've wanted to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2289.1s	2289.1	 more growth in is my shooting. And when I'm shooting the basketball on my own, I know for sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2295.3s	2295.3	 I've gotten better at shooting. Like, you know, you come in the gym with me, I shoot the lights out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2300.8s	2300.8	 every time. But it's about getting over that mental block in the game. You know, I think that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2306.7s	2306.7	 thing people don't realize is, you know, I shot the lights out for years in a row. And I had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2313.2s	2313.2	 year where I think I shot 39% from three. But then you go through the struggle. And once you lose it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2319.4s	2319.4	 mentally, it's hard to get it back. And so I'm fighting that challenge now, although I know I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2324.4s	2324.4	 can make the shot. So when you get in the game, mentally, got to get over that hurdle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2329.1s	2329.1	 What do you do? You do like meditation? Or do you have like a coach who does like positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2333.5s	2333.5	 visualizations or something like that? Or is it just reps and working through a shooting slump?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2339.9s	2339.9	 I've definitely incorporated some meditation on the calm app.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2365.7s	2365.7	 over the last year and the shutdown and the fits and starts and everything. I mean, is it kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2369.1s	2369.1	 tough to get in the game mentally for folks? And is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2371.5s	2371.5	 It's brutal. It's brutal. You know, you talk to guys around the league. There's even some guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2378.2s	2378.2	 and I won't throw anybody under the bus, but I'm talking about one superstar in particular who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2384.6s	2384.6	 I've never seen him out of shape. And he's so out of shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2395.0s	2395.0	 Not Luke or James are, but I've never seen this guy to shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2399.9s	2399.9	 And he's out of shape right now. And I asked him what he was playing. He's like, man,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2404.2s	2404.2	 the bubble, like it's just been hard. And I completely understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2410.9s	2410.9	 It's brutal. And this season currently, you know, I don't want to sound like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2417.5s	2417.5	 just this overprivileged guy who's complaining about being able to make a living because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2423.5s	2423.5	 so many people who's lost their jobs. And I don't take, you know, being able to go to work for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2428.5s	2428.5	 granted at all. But this season has been extremely tough. You know, whereas an NBA day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2434.1s	2434.1	 normally is like maybe four to six hours, like every day right now, it's like 10 to 12 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2441.3s	2441.3	 You know, it's COVID testing you for 11 a.m. practice. We have to be at the facility at 8 45
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2448.1s	2448.1	 a.m. And then you have to be back at the facility to test no later than five in between four and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2457.5s	2457.5	 five. And so you kind of have these long drawn out days and about maybe two hours of that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2465.3s	2465.3	 actual work time. You know, and then you're just trying to do some recovery things to kill time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2470.5s	2470.5	 You can't leave the hotel. You know, for myself, one thing that I've always found in the NBA season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2475.6s	2475.6	 is it's a ton of pressure, obviously, and it's very, very demanding. Like you can't really do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2483.5s	2483.5	 much else. As you guys know, I'm always trying to coordinate with you all about playing poker around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2487.9s	2487.9	 and stuff. You can't really do anything else. But one place that I found is normally I'll take like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2493.8s	2493.8	 a day trip to Aspen, you know, or do different things like that. A day trip to L.A. to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2499.4s	2499.4	 clear your mind and get a release. You don't have those releases now. You can't take a day trip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2504.1s	2504.1	 You can't get away. Even on off days, you have to go to the facility and test. And so even just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2510.0s	2510.0	 seeing that facility that day, although you may not even go in to work out, but you drive into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2515.0s	2515.0	 that facility every day mentally, it's exhausting. And so it's been a very tough season to say the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2520.7s	2520.7	 least. And I think a lot of guys are struggling with it and saying that, you know, we all want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2525.5s	2525.5	 to continue to earn our money. It must be better to be, it must be better to be playing versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2531.6s	2531.6	 being stuck at home with with the league shut down. Right. I mean, it's got to be better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2536.4s	2536.4	 Yeah, I mean, it's better for all of us, obviously, you know, from an economical standpoint,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2541.3s	2541.3	 we all want to continue to make money, you know, and provide for our families. We all want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2546.4s	2546.4	 continue to take this lead to new heights. So it's always better for us to be on the court than off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2552.1s	2552.1	 But that comes with certain challenges and you just got to deal with those challenges and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2556.3s	2556.3	 try to continue to press forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2557.9s	2557.9	 Day-Day, before you came on, we were talking about the media and we're talking about how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2562.7s	2562.7	 all these industries used to rely on the media to tell their story. And now all these industries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2569.6s	2569.6	 are finding ways to go around them. And it's even happening in venture capital, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2574.8s	2574.8	 In the business of sports, I found this thing that I thought was really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2580.4s	2580.4	 Ronaldo signed a $1 billion lifetime contract, right? I think this was like two, three years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2585.6s	2585.6	 insane. But then it turned out that in one year, he generated $474 million of value for Nike just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2596.0s	2596.0	 through social media because of the number of followers he had, which I think is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2601.5s	2601.5	 absolutely nuts. What do you think about the media? What do you think about your ability to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2607.4s	2607.4	 tell your version of the facts through the media? I think we've definitely grown in that area,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2613.8s	2613.8	 as you said, in all businesses, whether it's basketball, whether it's venture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2619.5s	2619.5	 just all over the board, everyone has grown in that area and start taking the bull by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2624.7s	2624.7	 horns and try to tell their own narrative. If you want me to be quite frank with you, I hate the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2630.2s	2630.2	 media. And I've been- So does Sachs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2636.2s	2636.2	 And saying that, I could possibly be a part of that group one day, but I hate the media. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2641.6s	2641.6	 the reason I hate the media is I don't hate particular people. I have relationships with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2648.1s	2648.1	 a ton of people in media, great people. I hate what media entails in today's day and age. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2655.4s	2655.4	 all about who can stir up the most commotion, what happened with this guy, what happened with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2661.4s	2661.4	 that guy. It's less about, man, this guy is struggling on the floor and more about James
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2667.9s	2667.9	 Harden was in the club. So how much controversy can we stir up about James Harden being in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2674.1s	2674.1	 club? As opposed to, if we really wanted to talk bad about James Harden, when he was on Houston
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2680.0s	2680.0	 Rockets, he was bumping it. Now we all know James Harden isn't a bomb player, but he was completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2685.5s	2685.5	 dogging it with the Houston Rockets. He's completely turned it up and turned back into James Harden as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2689.9s	2689.9	 he's gotten to the Nets. But you can easily, if you want to nitpick at James Harden, talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2695.6s	2695.6	 James Harden not playing well. But in turn, we're going to talk about James Harden being in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2700.5s	2700.5	 club that night and he was at Lil Baby's birthday party. And although I disagree with some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2705.9s	2705.9	 things he was doing, why is that all that- It's all about clicks and selling ad dollars against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2713.6s	2713.6	 that. We were just talking about that before you got on, Dre Larr.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2716.2s	2716.2	 Look at what happened to Kyrie. In the span of literally a week, Kyrie had both sides of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2721.1s	2721.1	 same coin. One was he violates the shelter in place or whatever and was at a birthday party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2725.9s	2725.9	 with his family and then he gets suspended. And on the other side, Kyrie had bought a house for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2731.4s	2731.4	 George Floyd's family. And so it's like both are true, but you have to go through these two news
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2736.9s	2736.9	 cycles where first he's just a piece of shit and then he's this amazing philanthropist. What's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2741.9s	2741.9	 point? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2743.4s	2743.4	 I agree. I don't get the point. Like Freeberg just said, it's all about clicks. And I think that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2754.5s	2754.5	 short lived. At some point, everyone's going to get tired of your click bait. And so yes, it may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2760.6s	2760.6	 drive you revenue right now. It may bring more subscribers right now. But in the long term,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2767.5s	2767.5	 people are going to get sick of that. At the end of the day, authenticity always wins out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2772.7s	2772.7	 When you create great products, when you give everything great to whatever business that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2778.7s	2778.7	 giving, that's always going to outlive the bullshit. And that's why you're starting to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2785.1s	2785.1	 so much turnover with media people and leaving this job and going to this place and leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2790.3s	2790.3	 another place because people get sick of that shit. And so I feel like all of these guys are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2795.1s	2795.1	 driving themselves out. You're constantly, you're killing your relationships with players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2800.1s	2800.1	 You're killing your and when I say players, I'm not just talking about NBA players. You guys are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2804.9s	2804.9	 the players in the venture space. We're the players in the basketball space. You're killing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2809.2s	2809.2	 your relationships with the players. So eventually you're just going to be stuck there tweeting out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2814.3s	2814.3	 bullshit, making bullshit articles that no one will co-sign to and then no one wants to fucking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2819.6s	2819.6	 hear you anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2822.5s	2822.5	 Oh boy, looks like we got our bestie in rotation now. That's going to get clipped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2826.7s	2826.7	 That's a little rant, a little Dreymon rant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2831.2s	2831.2	 Your first bestie rant, Dreymon. We've all had our moments. We've all had our rants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2837.1s	2837.1	 Dreymon, have you watched or listened to any of this podcast before?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2840.0s	2840.0	 Of course. Are you fucking kidding me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2842.0s	2842.0	 Oh, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2845.6s	2845.6	 I have a question actually. So, yeah, and I'm not sure if the viewers know because from Jason's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2850.9s	2850.9	 introduction that we actually play poker with you. That's how I got to know you. And, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2857.1s	2857.1	 obviously it's been a real thrill and because you're a great guy and it's also really interesting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2861.4s	2861.4	 get a window into your world. But I'm curious, like, what do you get out of hanging out with us?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2866.7s	2866.7	 A bunch of nerds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2868.3s	2868.3	 These losers and pariahs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2871.0s	2871.0	 Yeah. So, you know, and then, you know, maybe use that as a segue to also talk about what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2876.3s	2876.3	 doing in business these days because I think that's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2880.3s	2880.3	 What I get from hanging out with you guys is number one, incredible friends. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2885.6s	2885.6	 I think that's what's been the most important thing for me is just building friendships
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2890.6s	2890.6	 that will go far beyond any of you guys doing any deals or to go far beyond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2896.8s	2896.8	 me doing any deals or me playing basketball. And that's the thing that I cherish the most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2901.9s	2901.9	 You know, obviously it started with Bessie C bringing me into the poker game and introducing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2906.5s	2906.5	 me to everyone. And then all of you guys welcoming me with open arms. And, you know, I always say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2912.4s	2912.4	 in the groups in our group chats, anytime that there's a debate going on, I make sure to throw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2918.8s	2918.8	 my disclaimer out there. Hey, I can't talk anything to you guys. I know everyone can talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2923.8s	2923.8	 circles around me, but this is how I feel on said topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2930.3s	2930.3	 Tell us about the temperature in America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2934.9s	2934.9	 The temperature in America is fucked up. And I think, you know, where we are today as a country,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2943.4s	2943.4	 it's no different than where we were 30 years ago, 40 years ago. We just live in a day and age of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2948.7s	2948.7	 social media where we can see everything. And so the same battle cry that Dr. King was crying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2956.6s	2956.6	 50 years ago, it's still currently going on today. It's the same exact thing, or 60 years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2963.8s	2963.8	 It's the same exact things that's taking place today. And our country is one in one of the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2970.7s	2970.7	 in one of the most fucked up spaces it's ever been in. And in saying that, it's in just about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2976.9s	2976.9	 the same place that it's always been. And so, you know, we've super coded shit for so long that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2984.5s	2984.5	 it seems now like, oh, police killings are an all time high of shooting unarmed people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2991.8s	2991.8	 You know, racism is at an all time high. It's not an all time high. It's the same that it's been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=2997.4s	2997.4	 It's just on the it's being pushed to the forefront now, as opposed to being on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3003.1s	3003.1	 back burner before. And so that's just kind of where we are as a country. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3012.3s	3012.3	 You think sentiment is going to shift Draymond? I mean, you know, the protests that happened in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3017.2s	3017.2	 this country over the last year obviously happened during COVID. And I think it magnified them a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3022.9s	3022.9	 more than, you know, similar protests that have taken place historically. But, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3027.4s	3027.4	 are we seeing like sentiment shift in the United States in terms of policy and people's behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3032.1s	3032.1	 and attitudes right now? I think some people behavior but I don't think anything is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3039.3s	3039.3	 shift. And part and partly because we live in a fake ass world where no one can say anything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3045.7s	3045.7	 you say anything you get castrated for your I think, you know, in telling your truth, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3054.8s	3054.8	 in order to create the change that we need in America, people have to be able to speak the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3060.4s	3060.4	 truth. And if you can't speak the truth without getting fucking destroyed, and a part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3065.8s	3065.8	 bullshit cancel culture that we all have to deal with, then how can you ever create change through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3071.7s	3071.7	 a lie? Lies are what we've been facing for hundreds of years. But yet when you get in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3079.5s	3079.5	 front of a microphone, you have to be very conscious of what you say, because it may piss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3084.7s	3084.7	 this group of people off, or it may piss that group of people off. And then you're never allowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3088.7s	3088.7	 to tell the fucking truth. So how will we ever move forward as a country, if no one can tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3093.9s	3093.9	 the truth and you only get canceled? So you cancel who tells the truth, and we fucking push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3099.5s	3099.5	 for as all the lies will never move anywhere as a country. So I don't think we're going anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3104.4s	3104.4	 Seems like in the NBA, we went from the player saying, Listen, I don't want to touch that Michael
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3110.7s	3110.7	 Jordan was very clear in the last dance, like, you know, I'm an athlete, I don't want to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3115.1s	3115.1	 about politics, I don't want to lose half the audience. And then you had, you know, Mello,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3120.7s	3120.7	 and, you know, LeBron and a bunch of folks see Chris Paul, I guess was in that group to Dwayne
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3126.7s	3126.7	 Wade when they came out and said, Hey, listen, we got to talk about this. And we got to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3129.5s	3129.5	 about race in America. And then that culminated with the Black Lives Matter branding of everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3137.6s	3137.6	 in the bubble and that kind of historic moment. What's the what's what was the vibe inside of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3143.9s	3143.9	 NBA? When the player said, Listen, this is important to us, if we're going to get back on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3148.3s	3148.3	 the court, we need to make this front and center, this is our priority. And then let's face it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3154.2s	3154.2	 you got a lot of owners in the league, maybe who are old white guys, maybe they don't want to bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3159.5s	3159.5	 this kind of heat, they don't want this kind of debate, they want to just play ball, shut up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3163.3s	3163.3	 dribble all this nonsense. What was that moment like, when you guys said, No, this is what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3167.9s	3167.9	 have to do if we're going to get back on the court? I think I think guys have just had enough. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3173.7s	3173.7	 more, most importantly, I think now more than ever, guys truly understand the power of the athlete,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3183.6s	3183.6	 exactly closing the loop on what we just said, you we control the narrative, you control the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3188.2s	3188.2	 narrative. Absolutely. And so we're just kind of in a space where we understand, this ship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3195.3s	3195.3	 don't sell without us. And the things that matter to us has to matter to the league. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3201.1s	3201.1	 right. And saying that I think we have a commissioner that supports everything we stand for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3207.9s	3207.9	 And when you have a commissioner like Adam Silver, who is in full support of everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3213.3s	3213.3	 that the players stand for, is never trying to fight us is never trying to put a muzzle on us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3217.9s	3217.9	 and tell us not to stand up for what we believe in. That that's a very powerful thing. And that's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3223.4s	3223.4	 the NBA is the most powerful sports league in the world. Because we have a commissioner who's on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3229.1s	3229.1	 board and who not only supports what the players think and what we believe in, but he takes it even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3236.9s	3236.9	 a step further. And you don't see that you see the NFL tell guys you have to stay, or stay in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3246.2s	3246.2	 locker room. Adam Silver don't do that to us. And that's why there's always friction between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3252.7s	3252.7	 their commissioner and their players. David, what did you think about the storm the Capitol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3256.5s	3256.5	 when you were watching that? What was going through your mind? We see the two different sides of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3262.1s	3262.1	 America. The first thing that went through my mind was, I wonder if that was a Black Lives Matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3267.9s	3267.9	 protest, or Black Lives Matter protest or stormed in the Capitol, how much of a bloodbath it would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3275.4s	3275.4	 have been? It would have been one of the biggest bloodbaths in American history. And so immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3284.9s	3284.9	 when I saw it, the first thing I thought of was like, wow, how is this even happening? Like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3292.1s	3292.1	 and let alone it not happening. No one, and by the way, I don't wish death on anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3299.0s	3299.0	 But I know that if those were melanated people storming into the Capitol building,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3306.3s	3306.3	 it would have been bloodshed everywhere. It would have unloaded facts. Absolutely. And so it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3312.1s	3312.1	 kind of really, once again, just revealed how there's two sides of America. And as I said before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3319.8s	3319.8	 until we tell the truth about it, we'll continue to live in a day and age where there will be two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3325.6s	3325.6	 sides of America. Draymond, when COVID first started, and we went into lockdown, and we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3330.5s	3330.5	 all texting with each other talking about how crazy the world had become, one of the things that stuck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3335.5s	3335.5	 with me and still sticks with me is the comments you made over our text chain about how it feels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3340.9s	3340.9	 like you felt growing up. Can you just explain what you meant by that and just share that with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3346.4s	3346.4	 our audience that's listening? Because it was such a striking comment. We were all like, oh my gosh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3351.4s	3351.4	 I can't go outside. I can't go to the store. This world is crazy. And you were like, this is what it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3355.9s	3355.9	 was like. And it was just such a striking, maybe you can just share a little bit about what you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3358.9s	3358.9	 meant by that. Because I think it paints a little bit of a picture for folks to understand a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3364.7s	3364.7	 bit about what America can be like and what it's like growing up in parts of the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3371.7s	3371.7	 Well, number one, I want to point out that I told all of y'all the first day we went into lockdown,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3376.3s	3376.3	 we all should go to Cabo and no one listened to me. It was a good call. It was a good call. You were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3382.6s	3382.6	 right. We should all go to Cabo. Oh yeah. No, but when I said that in the group chat, what I said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3390.3s	3390.3	 in the group chat was, honestly, I was in my condo in San Francisco. I live in a high rise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3398.4s	3398.4	 great view of the Bay Bridge, great view of the water. You see all of San Francisco, South San
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3403.4s	3403.4	 Francisco, everywhere. And I said to the group chat after a few weeks of lockdown, I said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3411.6s	3411.6	 guys, I have to be quite frank with you. This feels no different than me growing up in Saginaw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3416.4s	3416.4	 Michigan. And what I mean by that, I said, this feels no different than me growing up in Saginaw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3423.0s	3423.0	 Michigan. The only difference is I know where my next meal is coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3427.9s	3427.9	 And I'm in a much better place living space than I was, but this feels no different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3434.2s	3434.2	 Unlocked in, I can't go anywhere. That was me growing up in Saginaw, Michigan. Locked in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3439.1s	3439.1	 couldn't go anywhere, didn't know that there was a world that existed outside of Saginaw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3443.9s	3443.9	 Michigan. And basketball was able to take me different places, but I didn't know anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3448.5s	3448.5	 existed and nothing seemed accessible to a young black kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3454.4s	3454.4	 So once I was then locked in the house along with everyone else in the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3460.1s	3460.1	 it just took me back to a space of, wow, nothing else is accessible to me. This was exactly what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3467.9s	3467.9	 it was when I was growing up as a 10 year old. Like nothing was accessible to us. We didn't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3473.1s	3473.1	 anything. That's how, and so when we went into lockdown, I felt right at home, I felt like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3481.7s	3481.7	 kid growing up in Saginaw again, nothing was accessible to me. But it's such a poignant point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3487.1s	3487.1	 Draymond, because so many people don't, you know, people don't have that experience, but hearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3492.0s	3492.0	 you say that it provides perspective that there are people living that today. And it's not just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3498.1s	3498.1	 about a COVID lockdown, but it's about a different world that we don't get to see. So I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3503.1s	3503.1	 appreciated you sharing that. It honestly was very poignant and kind of struck a nerve with me when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3507.3s	3507.3	 you said it. Absolutely. I think, you know, one thing, another thing I said in the chat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3512.9s	3512.9	 and I am included, we all got a chance to see what it felt like to be those people. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3520.3s	3520.3	 obviously I lived that life growing up, but once you're removed from it, you're removed from it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3525.1s	3525.1	 right? Like I, you know, you try not to never forget, but let's be frank, you know, Shamap,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3530.4s	3530.4	 Shamap, you grew up with nothing coming from India and, or Sri Lanka and going to Canada,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3536.3s	3536.3	 you had nothing. You understand. And, you know, we all understand from a different perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3541.7s	3541.7	 but there are still people currently that live that live that life today. And it gave all of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3547.8s	3547.8	 a glimpse of what those people go through on a daily basis. The one, the one thing about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3552.9s	3552.9	 pandemic is that I've had these moments, they were like, I actually now am a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3557.7s	3557.7	 connected to my past. I did this, I did this podcast with this guy, Patrick O'Shaughnessy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3563.0s	3563.0	 and he ends every podcast and he says, you know, what is the kindest thing that some somebody has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3569.1s	3569.1	 done to you? And I had pushed this memory down into the fucking recesses of my mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3575.0s	3575.0	 except in this last year, I've remembered all these kindnesses, because I've, I've now, I've,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3581.1s	3581.1	 these are the moments where I felt the most insecure. And I, and I told the story about this kid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3586.2s	3586.2	 who, you know, when I was like 11 or 12, he was eight. So he was in my sister's class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3592.3s	3592.3	 and their family gave us a mattress, two mattresses and some clothes, you know, some plates and like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3599.4s	3599.4	 frying pan and a pot, literally when we got refugee status. And when I said it on the thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3607.1s	3607.1	 I started bawling and then I kind of collected myself. And then-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3610.7s	3610.7	 I'm getting a little acclaimed even hearing you talk about it, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3613.5s	3613.5	 Well, and the next, the next morning, Nat said, how did it go? And I told her and I exploded and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3622.3s	3622.3	 I was crying and crying and crying and crying. And to your point, like it is so easy to forget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3629.2s	3629.2	 where you come from, but it's also easy to forget that there's a simple fucking externality. In this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3634.3s	3634.3	 case, it's a, it's a virus you can't see that gets trans and it makes us all the same in one fell soup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3641.0s	3641.0	 in one nanosecond. And if that doesn't make you sort of like empathetic to everybody, nothing will,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3646.5s	3646.5	 but that's one silver lining in this whole fucking debacle is it's an opportunity for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3653.5s	3653.5	 a lot of folks to reconnect with their own self, you know, and be a better person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3658.3s	3658.3	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3659.1s	3659.1	 There's something you paused on Draymond during the pandemic when you weren't playing and you guys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3664.0s	3664.0	 obviously, with the injuries and everything, didn't, you weren't in the bubble. So you had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3668.5s	3668.5	 a lot of time to be with yourself. Did you have any like during this great pause, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3676.1s	3676.1	 I don't know, revelations about yourself, your career and what you want to do in the second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3681.6s	3681.6	 half of your career? Because let's be honest. I mean, the run the Warriors has had has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3686.1s	3686.1	 transcendent. I mean, you guys have checked off every box. You personally have checked off every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3691.0s	3691.0	 box, especially for a guy who was drafted in the second round to be a champion. And like the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3695.5s	3695.5	 you've developed and the leadership, I mean, everybody in the league knows when you're on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3699.4s	3699.4	 the court, that's the team and you have that leadership, the ability to see the floor and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3704.1s	3704.1	 direct the offense, direct the defense. Did you come up with anything? We said, this is what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3708.8s	3708.8	 want out of the future of my life because we saw you dabble with, you know, TNT and the desk and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3713.8s	3713.8	 you killed it. We've seen you mic'd up. We see you coaching now. It seems like there's a 2.0 Draymond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3720.2s	3720.2	 like maybe a little evolution here of your thinking about maybe the third act and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3724.0s	3724.0	 second half of your NBA career on the court. You know, I had a lot of time to really sit and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3728.9s	3728.9	 reflect. You know, I grew a lot in my personal relationships, which I think was important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3736.3s	3736.3	 You know, and I think I also grew a lot as a business professional as well. And speaking of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3745.4s	3745.4	 you know, the TNT stuff, that was, I think, you know, we've kind of always or I've kind of always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3752.3s	3752.3	 heard, like, man, when you finish playing, you'll have a great career in TV. But the reality is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3758.8s	3758.8	 you know, we've seen some players, you know, that were really good players get up there and not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3766.2s	3766.2	 be very, you know, be very good sitting at the desk or, you know, color commentating the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3775.4s	3775.4	 And so it's not as easy as most people think it is. People think just because you play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3781.9s	3781.9	 basketball, A, that you know basketball, and then B, that you're going to help you're going to be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3788.7s	3788.7	 to translate or help give everyone else an understanding of what exactly it is that you see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3798.3s	3798.3	 And so getting up there and actually being able to do it. And then the reception that I got,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3804.1s	3804.1	 which was people, you know, in my mind, I've always said, I want to be Tony Romo of the NBA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3811.9s	3811.9	 Tony Romo is one of my favorite people to watch do color commentary, because he makes it very simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3819.7s	3819.7	 for you to understand. He tell you, Tony Romo sit there and call the plays out there, the team is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3825.5s	3825.5	 about to run just by seeing the formation. And they do exactly what he said they're about to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3830.7s	3830.7	 It's the most incredible thing. And, and speaking of which we were talking about earlier, which was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3835.8s	3835.8	 the media. One of the things that pissed me off most about the game of basketball today is I can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3842.5s	3842.5	 turn on a sports talk show and actually learn about basketball. And that fucking pisses me off. All I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3847.9s	3847.9	 can turn on a talk show about is they're about bullshit. But the reality is we have so many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3855.5s	3855.5	 people talking and speaking about the game of basketball that don't know shit. And so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3863.2s	3863.2	 you can't turn on the TV and learn. And so the one thing I'll say I want to bring to that world is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3868.7s	3868.7	 I want to be able to teach the game of basketball. And then for people to then contact me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3874.7s	3874.7	 once I was sitting up there at the desk, and inside on inside NBA, and doing all of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3879.9s	3879.9	 different things to contact me and say, the way you break the game down makes it so easy to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3885.8s	3885.8	 That was a huge win for me. And it gave me a lot of hope to want to succeed more in that area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3890.4s	3890.4	 Well, I'll say something different, which is what I see is just an incredibly beautiful human being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3899.2s	3899.2	 because you're able to humanize that, but then you can go and speak on these other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3906.0s	3906.0	 That's actually what we need more of because all of a sudden now it's very hard to put people in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3911.5s	3911.5	 a box. And it shows that we are all multifaceted. It's just that sometimes we don't get the exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3917.1s	3917.1	 Meaning, I would say I have different facets of my personality because we've been friends for so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3923.5s	3923.5	 long. And that's a gift you gave to me. You just said being in that group chat with us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3929.0s	3929.0	 which can be a cacophonous fucking mess sometimes. That group chat can never get out of the wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3934.6s	3934.6	 Never to be published.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3939.0s	3939.0	 But the point is, and this goes back to this first thing, we can now really be authentic and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3944.4s	3944.4	 show all these different facets of ourselves. And it's just like, to me, that's what's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3948.6s	3948.6	 important because then people see that there is more than, like the best rebuttal to that whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3957.3s	3957.3	 shut up and dribble, which was so fucking offensive, is literally for you to be great at basketball,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3962.3s	3962.3	 great at broadcasting, great as a person who can comment on the social times of our moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3968.5s	3968.5	 great businessman. And then I'm just going to put one thing out there right now. Eventually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3972.9s	3972.9	 great fucking politician because this is like, now you want to talk about somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3977.0s	3977.0	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3977.0s	3977.0	 No, but you want to talk about somebody who can galvanize interest and his leader.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3979.9s	3979.9	 There's an open governor, I think, coming out, Draymond, and someone on our podcast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3984.9s	3984.9	 no longer running apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3986.2s	3986.2	 Guys, guys, I'm going to make a prediction that our bestie will be the governor of Michigan or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3993.3s	3993.3	 the governor of California before the time he's 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3996.7s	3996.7	 Love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3997.4s	3997.4	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=3998.3s	3998.3	 Thank you. I appreciate that. Maybe, I mean, I love the state of Michigan as home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4004.9s	4004.9	 but I think California will be home for me for the rest of my life. So possibly California.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4010.3s	4010.3	 We're calling you some.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4011.5s	4011.5	 Hey Draymond, let me ask you a question. You're on Twitter, I understand. You have a Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4016.6s	4016.6	 handle. Sometimes you check it out. Did you see Chamath's picture with his shirt off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4024.3s	4024.3	 David, did you see the thirst trap? Did you see it? Tell the truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4028.7s	4028.7	 I mean, he looked away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4030.9s	4030.9	 If we all know Chamath, I'm sorry, he probably sent it to the fucking group chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4036.4s	4036.4	 He sent the outtakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4039.1s	4039.1	 Wanted all of us to say, thanks, Chamath, you look fucking great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4043.7s	4043.7	 I definitely saw the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4046.5s	4046.5	 Actually, I'm the one who posted it to the group chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4050.3s	4050.3	 No, that's posted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4051.8s	4051.8	 And my comment was Chamath Kardashian, question mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4058.3s	4058.3	 You put the camera in front of your face. You were like, it looked like this. It was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4069.4s	4069.4	 Day-Day taught me how to do this. He's the...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4071.1s	4071.1	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4073.1s	4073.1	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4075.2s	4075.2	 That's enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4075.7s	4075.7	 Okay, guys, listen, we're nearing the end of our podcast. Jason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4080.6s	4080.6	 do you want to tell Day-Day what we're going to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4083.0s	4083.0	 Okay, so some people have given some reviews or just feedback on the pod, on the besties,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4090.3s	4090.3	 maybe even you, Draymond. And so we thought it would be incredibly uncomfortable and funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4096.6s	4096.6	 for us to read some of these. So, Sax, why don't you kick us off with one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4101.9s	4101.9	 Well, there's a really good pie chart here, which Nick can show, which shows all in pod talk time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4109.0s	4109.0	 And it's basically mostly Chamath and then Jason with both Davids filling like a tiny little piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4117.1s	4117.1	 And then the majority of it is Chamath and Jason talking over each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4124.1s	4124.1	 Bored Elon Musk posted that, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4126.1s	4126.1	 Yeah. Here's one from BrooklynGal212 on Sax. One star review. Sax, go ahead and read this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4131.8s	4131.8	 one star review from BrooklynGal212.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4134.3s	4134.3	 Yeah, she says that David Sax ruins every conversation on this pod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4139.1s	4139.1	 You forgot the period. All right. Here's one about Chamath. Go ahead, Chamath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4143.1s	4143.1	 This is Chamath. Yeah, Chamath, read this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4145.3s	4145.3	 Okay. It's from Howard Axel Rourke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4150.5s	4150.5	 With a pill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4152.2s	4152.2	 With a pill. It says, every time Chamath does something to make me like him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4156.8s	4156.8	 he does two things to make me hate his guts. Go fuck yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4161.5s	4161.5	 I think we can all relate to that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4164.4s	4164.4	 Sounds like me and my playing career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4166.1s	4166.1	 Everyone fucking hates me, man. It's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4172.7s	4172.7	 Draymond, I will tell you when I first thought about putting a tweet out for like the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4177.1s	4177.1	 time, you were the one who said, man, everyone's going to talk shit, but forget the haters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4180.3s	4180.3	 That's just the way it goes when you start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4181.9s	4181.9	 Oh yeah, fuck them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4185.3s	4185.3	 Absolutely.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4201.5s	4201.5	 Oh, too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4202.0s	4202.0	 Twitter offered two blue Chuck marks. You'd have three. Your zealotry has made even Bill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4207.1s	4207.1	 Moore blush and the other besties cringe when you can't take even a slight ribbing. It's so bad now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4212.4s	4212.4	 The besties have started their own side chat without you. At your funeral, the besties will

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4239.1s	4239.1	 Three stars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4240.1s	4240.1	 Jason and Chamath make good points, but the other two are such whiny nerds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4245.9s	4245.9	 one of whom is clearly right wing wannabe vanilla ISIS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4251.4s	4251.4	 Jesus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4252.8s	4252.8	 Oh my Lord. Did he just call you a terrorist, Sacks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4258.8s	4258.8	 I think he's referring to Freeberg.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4269.5s	4269.5	 Evil Jason. Okay, here we go. This is from Adam Keem. He posted this on January 30th,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4274.7s	4274.7	 so not long ago, he gives me a full one star, which I think one star is like number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4279.1s	4279.1	 right? Five stars is fifth place. First star is one place. Jason Calacan is a monster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4284.8s	4284.8	 Monster, not monster.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZD39tiKgc&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=115&t=4286.7s	4286.7	 Monster. Wow. After listening to Jason on the latest podcast, I Am Floored, period.
