https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=163.4s	163.4	 If I was getting five but paid five bucks for this I'd be on strike right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=167.8s	167.8	 Guys, not only are you getting five bucks. You're getting a bill for the production. Okay, here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=171.6s	171.6	 By the way, how beautiful is it that the same reporters who couldn't stop writing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=177.3s	177.3	 About the oppressive working conditions that Elon Musk was supposedly creating because he simply wanted the employees to go back to the office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=183.7s	183.7	 And work hard and if they didn't he'd give him a generous three months severance package
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=188.2s	188.2	 Yeah, those same reporters are now on strike because the Solsburgers are running a clickbait farm over there with oppressive working conditions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=195.0s	195.0	 The intellectual dishonesty has never been higher in the world. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=200.6s	200.6	 Honesty, yes will the publisher of the New York Times agree that anybody who isn't happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=206.8s	206.8	 There can have a voluntary three months severance package

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=215.4s	215.4	 Did that you know it would happen eight hundred of twelve hundred people would take the severance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=219.8s	219.8	 Of course. All right. Here we go Twitter files have dropped part one dropped with the legendary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=226.4s	226.4	 award-winning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=227.7s	227.7	 Highly respected journalist Matt Taibbi if you don't know who he is. He is a left-leaning journalist who worked at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=234.6s	234.6	 Rolling Stone and did the best coverage hands down of the financial crisis and the shenanigans and he held truth to power to that group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=242.0s	242.0	 This is important to note
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=243.6s	243.6	 The second drop was given to Barry Weiss who is a right-leaning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=249.7s	249.7	 Independent journalist. These are both independent journalists. She previously worked at the New York Times itself now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=257.0s	257.0	 I think we should work backwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=260.1s	260.1	 From two to one. Do you agree? Yes for sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=263.2s	263.2	 Let's start with the drop that just happened last night. Yes. So last night a drop happened. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=268.1s	268.1	 Here's what happens in Twitter files part two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=271.3s	271.3	 I'm gonna give a basic summary and then I'm gonna give it to sax because he's chomping at the bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=274.5s	274.5	 We now have confirmation that what the right thought was happening all along which is a secret
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=281.3s	281.3	 silencing system built into the software of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=285.3s	285.3	 Blacklists was tagging right-wing conservative voices in the system and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=291.6s	291.6	 These included people like Dan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=295.1s	295.1	 Bungino, is that he a pronounce it? Yes, he was tagged with being on a search blacklist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=300.2s	300.2	 what that means is you're a fan of Dan's who is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=304.1s	304.1	 Former Secret Service agent who is now a right-wing conservative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=307.7s	307.7	 I could just say conservative instead of wing a conservative radio host podcast host
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=312.9s	312.9	 He was not allowed to be found in search engines for some reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=317.6s	317.6	 Charlie Kirk who is a conservative commentator he was tagged with do not amplify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=322.3s	322.3	 I guess that means you can't trend into people's feeds even if they follow you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=327.5s	327.5	 then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=328.8s	328.8	 There were people who were banned from the trends blacklist including a Stanford professor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=334.6s	334.6	 Jay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=335.7s	335.7	 thought to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=337.4s	337.4	 Charya, did I get it right? Yes, Jay about a char. Yeah, okay. I got it right doctor of Stanford School of Medicine and he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=345.7s	345.7	 Not allowed on the trends blacklist because he had a dissenting opinion a Stanford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=353.1s	353.1	 Professor had a dissenting opinion on kovat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=355.3s	355.3	 That's turned out to be true and this is where the danger comes in because all of these actions were taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=361.9s	361.9	 without any transparency and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=365.6s	365.6	 They were taken on one side of the aisle by people inside of Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=371.8s	371.8	 Essentially covertly no ownership of who did it and they never told the people they gaslit them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=378.9s	378.9	 They could see their own tweets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=382.1s	382.1	 They could use the service, but they couldn't be seen even by their own fans in many cases here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=389.0s	389.0	 Sax when you look at that, let's just start with that first piece
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=392.7s	392.7	 The shadow banning as it's called in our industry where you can participate in a community, but you can't be seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=401.4s	401.4	 Are any is there any circumstance under which this tool would make sense for you to deploy and then what's your general take?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=408.6s	408.6	 On what has been discovered last night? Okay. Look what was question? Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=412.9s	412.9	 Well, you may start with what's been discovered here. Let me boil it down for you. This is an FTX level fraud
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=420.3s	420.3	 Except that what was stolen here was not customer funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=423.4s	423.4	 It was their free speech rights not just the rights of people like Jay about a Charya and Dan Bongino to speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=429.1s	429.1	 But the right of the public to hear them in the way that they expected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=434.0s	434.0	 Okay, and you had statement after statement by Twitter executives like Jack Dorsey like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=440.7s	440.7	 Vijaya Gaudi like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=443.0s	443.0	 You know yo well and others saying we do not shadow ban and then they also said we certainly this is their emphasis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=450.4s	450.4	 Do not shadow ban on the basis of political viewpoint and what the Twitter files show is that is exactly what they were doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=457.3s	457.3	 They in the same way that SPF was using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=461.0s	461.0	 FTX and customer funds as his personal piggy bank. They were using Twitter as their personal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=467.1s	467.1	 Ideological piggy bank they were going in to the tools and using the content moderation system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=472.1s	472.1	 These big brother like tools that were designed to basically put their thumb on the scale of American democracy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=478.6s	478.6	 Suppress viewpoints that they did not agree with and they did not like even when even when they could not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=485.6s	485.6	 Justify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=486.8s	486.8	 Removing content based on their own rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=489.1s	489.1	 So there are conversations in the slack that Barry Weiss exposed where for example Libs of tik-tok
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=494.8s	494.8	 They admit in the slack that we can't suppress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=498.7s	498.7	 Libs of tip top based on our hate policy Libs of tik-tok hasn't violated it. We're gonna suppress that account anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=505.1s	505.1	 Now it's important to note what Libs of tik-tok does. This is a great talking point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=509.5s	509.5	 Libs of tik-tok finds people who are trans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=514.2s	514.2	 people who are you know, maybe not LGBTQ and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=519.2s	519.2	 they feature their tik-toks and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=522.3s	522.3	 They mock them on Twitter now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=524.8s	524.8	 This certainly is free speech and the argument from the safety team was by putting all of these together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=531.4s	531.4	 You're inciting violence towards those people and they said they haven't broken a rule but collectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=537.8s	537.8	 They could be in some way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=540.9s	540.9	 Targeting those people is there anything fair Friedberg to that statement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=547.0s	547.0	 That they targeted them by collecting their let's say views that are I'm asking this question for discussion purposes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=555.0s	555.0	 I'm not giving my take out hold on. I want free bird. Why can't I finish? I'm gonna go back to you spoke for two minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=560.7s	560.7	 That's why Friedberg you turned down moderating today sacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=563.9s	563.9	 You could everybody else gets to decide as long as they want I get interrupted you got two minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=569.3s	569.3	 Let me just finish the SPF analogy, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=571.6s	571.6	 And then you can filibuster continue you can then you can both sides this is already sex while you're speaking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=576.3s	576.3	 Listen up one or two words on you and then yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=578.4s	578.4	 Why did people like Goddy and you'll well deny that they were engaged in shadow banning even though that's clearly what they were doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=584.9s	584.9	 Because they knew that they had an obligation to be stewards of the public trust. They were custodians of public trust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=592.5s	592.5	 They knew they were violating that trust the same way that SPF had a duty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=598.8s	598.8	 to be custodians of his customers funds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=601.1s	601.1	 They did not implement their own policy that they said they were implementing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=605.4s	605.4	 Why because they were suppressing accounts that personally offended them that personally they disagreed with and they wanted to deprive the public of the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=613.5s	613.5	 To hear okay. So now the way that they're justifying this hold on the way that the media is today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=617.9s	617.9	 Justifying it is they're pointing to obscure provisions in the terms of use around spam accounts things like that saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=624.2s	624.2	 Oh, well the terms of use show that they had the right to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=627.6s	627.6	 This is like the margin account. Okay, they did not have the right to use these tools in this way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=634.0s	634.0	 Okay, the J Balacharya was not posting spam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=644.3s	644.3	 Has been proven correct completely he was opposed to lockdowns that was the great Barrington declaration and they suppressed it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=651.7s	651.7	 What is the justification for now? You have to answer my question then Sax since you want to talk so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=656.9s	656.9	 Hold on Sax. I want you to answer the question then since you are so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=662.1s	662.1	 Want him to answer one question then it's going to you free bird Sax should lives of tik-tok be able to collect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=670.1s	670.1	 trans people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=671.8s	671.8	 Living their life making tik-toks put them into a group feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=676.8s	676.8	 mock them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=680.1s	680.1	 If those people experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=683.3s	683.3	 Harassment because of it is that something that Twitter should allow I'm asking you this without giving my opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=688.6s	688.6	 I'm curious your opinion specifically for the lives of tik-tok since you open that door and you wanted to bring up that very thorny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=695.1s	695.1	 Issue go listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=696.6s	696.6	 So on lips of tik-tok my understanding of that account is that they only take videos that have already been made public by another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=703.8s	703.8	 I guess they're all public. They're all in the public domain and then they repost them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=709.0s	709.0	 Sometimes they make a snarky comment, but usually they just let them stand on their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=712.7s	712.7	 That is not a violation of free speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=714.7s	714.7	 now the way that I think these Twitter executives have interpreted it is that they live in such a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=721.1s	721.1	 Bubble and they live in it with such privilege and entitlement that they think that when their point of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=727.9s	727.9	 Gets criticized or challenged that that in and of itself is harassment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=731.9s	731.9	 That's not that is public debate and they want to make themselves and their points of view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=736.9s	736.9	 Immune to public debate and the way that they do that is that they claim that any criticism is harassment. It's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=743.4s	743.4	 If in aggregate final final follow-up if an aggregate those people report being harassed and they have evidence of being harassed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=750.3s	750.3	 What should Twitter do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=751.4s	751.4	 Listen, if somebody is harassed, I'm fine with taking that down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=755.3s	755.3	 But being publicly criticized or simply retweeted is not harassment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=760.0s	760.0	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=761.0s	761.0	 Harassment needs to be targeted and it needs to be more than just public criticism or even a snarky comment here or there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=767.4s	767.4	 and so you don't consider a not, you know a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=770.9s	770.9	 daily feed of trans people being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=774.8s	774.8	 Mocked you don't consider that target harassment. Got it. Don't listen to me about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=779.0s	779.0	 Listen to Twitter's own slack files about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=782.3s	782.3	 They knew that the account that lives of tick-tock was not violating the rules yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=787.0s	787.0	 They suppressed that they suspended it six times they knew they were on shaky ground they wanted to do it anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=792.4s	792.4	 Why is they because they're people are experiencing harassment? That's why they did it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=796.2s	796.2	 But it is a thorny freedom of speech issue. I agree with you. I think I think sex has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=804.8s	804.8	 Articulated a vision for the product he wanted Twitter to be but I don't think that's necessarily the product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=812.6s	812.6	 That they wanted to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=814.4s	814.4	 It's not that Twitter set out at the time or stated clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=818.4s	818.4	 That they were going to be the harbinger of truth and the free speech platform for all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=822.3s	822.3	 I think they were really clear and they have been in their behavior and as you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=827.9s	827.9	 Demonstrated through this stuff that came out which to me feels a lot like a we already knew all this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=832.9s	832.9	 This is a bit of a nothing burger that they were curating and they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=838.0s	838.0	 Editing and they were editorializing other people's content and the ranking of content in the same way that many other internet platforms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=846.1s	846.1	 Do to create what they believe to be their best user experience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=850.6s	850.6	 For the users that they want to appeal to and I'll say like there's been this long debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=856.3s	856.3	 And it goes back 20 years at this point on how Google does ranking right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=860.7s	860.7	 I mean you guys may remember Jeremy stoppleman went to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=863.4s	863.4	 DC and he complained about how Google was using his content and he wasn't being ranked high enough as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=868.7s	868.7	 Google's own content that was being shoved in the wrong place and there's a guy who ran kind of he was a spokesperson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=875.1s	875.1	 For the SEO the search engine optimization rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=879.4s	879.4	 At Google and it was always the secret at Google
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=882.1s	882.1	 How did the search results get ranked and I can tell you it's not just a pure algorithm that there was a lot of manual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=888.6s	888.6	 Intervention a lot of manual work. In fact, the manual work gets to be to the point that they said there's so much stuff that we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=893.9s	893.9	 Is a is the best content and the best form of content for the user experience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=899.1s	899.1	 That they ranked it all the way at the top and they called it the one box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=901.9s	901.9	 It's the stuff that sits above the primary search results and that editorialization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=906.5s	906.5	 Ultimately led to a product that they intended to make because they believed it was a better user
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=911.0s	911.0	 Experience for the users that they wanted to service and I don't think that this is any different than what's happened at Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=918.2s	918.2	 Twitter is not a government agency. They're not a free speech. They're not the Internet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=922.2s	922.2	 They're a product and the product managers and the people that run that that product team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=927.7s	927.7	 Ultimately made some editorial decisions that said this is the content we do want to show and this is the content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=932.7s	932.7	 We don't want to show and they certainly did wrap up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=935.9s	935.9	 You know a bunch of rules that had a lot of leeway for what they could or couldn't do or they gave themselves a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=941.5s	941.5	 Of different excuses on how to do it. I don't agree with it. It's not the product I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=945.5s	945.5	 It's not the product. I think should exist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=947.7s	947.7	 I think Elon also saw that and clearly he stepped in and said I want to make a product that is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=953.1s	953.1	 Different product than what is being created today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=955.2s	955.2	 So none of this feels to me like these guys were the guardians of the Internet and they came along and they were distrustful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=961.5s	961.5	 They did exactly what they what a lot of other companies have done exactly what they set out to do and they editorialize the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=967.6s	967.6	 Product for a certain user group and by the way, they never blocked they never edited people's tweets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=972.4s	972.4	 They changed how people's results were showing up in rankings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=975.4s	975.4	 They showed how viral they would get in the trend box. Those were in-app features and in-app services
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=981.3s	981.3	 This was not about taking someone's tweets and changing it and people may feel ashamed and they may feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=987.4s	987.4	 You know upset about the fact that they were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=990.8s	990.8	 Deranked or they were kind of quote shadow banned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=993.8s	993.8	 But ultimately that's the product they chose to make and people have the choice in the option of going elsewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=999.3s	999.3	 And I don't agree with it and it's not the product I want and it's not a product I want to use and I certainly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1004.4s	1004.4	 Don't feel happy seeing it. But you want to see products in you aren't free work to summarize it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1009.2s	1009.2	 You want to see the free market do its job?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1011.3s	1011.3	 Chamath you worked at Facebook Facebook seems to have done I would say an excellent job with content moderation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1018.2s	1018.2	 I think in large part correct me if I'm wrong because of the real names policy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1022.7s	1022.7	 But you tell us what you think, you know when you look at this and the 15-year history of social media and moderation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1029.8s	1029.8	 I think moderation is incredibly difficult and typically what happens is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1035.0s	1035.0	 early on in a company's lifecycle and I I'm gonna guess that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1039.3s	1039.3	 Twitter and YouTube were very similar to what we did at Facebook and it's very similar to probably what tick-tock had to do in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1046.1s	1046.1	 the early days which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1047.7s	1047.7	 You have this massive tidal wave of usage and so you're always on a little bit of a hamster wheel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1054.6s	1054.6	 And so you build these very basic tools and you uncover problems along the way and so I I think it's important to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1064.6s	1064.6	 Humanize the people that are at Twitter because I'm not sure that there are these super nefarious actors per se
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1070.0s	1070.0	 I do think that they were conflicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1072.0s	1072.0	 I do think that they made some very corrupting decisions, but I don't think that they were these evil actors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1078.2s	1078.2	 Okay, I think that they were folks who?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1081.8s	1081.8	 Against the tidal wave of usage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1083.9s	1083.9	 built some brittle tools built on top of them built on top of it some more and tried to find a way of coping and as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1090.6s	1090.6	 scale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1092.3s	1092.3	 increased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1093.4s	1093.4	 They didn't have an opportunity to take a step back and reset and I think that that's true for all of these companies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1098.5s	1098.5	 And so you're just seeing it out in the light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1101.4s	1101.4	 What's happening at Twitter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1102.6s	1102.6	 But don't for a second think that any other company behaved any differently Google Facebook Twitter bite dance and tick-tock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1109.4s	1109.4	 They're all the same. They're all dealing with this problem and they're all probably trying to do a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1114.7s	1114.7	 Decent job of it as best as they know how so what do we do from here is the question? Okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1120.3s	1120.3	 the reason somebody needs to do something about this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1123.8s	1123.8	 Summarized really elegantly in this J Bhattacharya tweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1128.2s	1128.2	 So please Nick just throw it up here so that we can just talk about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1132.8s	1132.8	 This is why I think that this issue is important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1137.1s	1137.1	 Critically is a perfect tweet still trying to process my emotions on learning that Twitter blacklisted me. Okay, who cares about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1144.2s	1144.2	 Here's what matters the thought that will keep me up tonight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1148.6s	1148.6	 censorship of scientific discussion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1151.5s	1151.5	 permitted policies like school closures and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1154.4s	1154.4	 A generation of children were hurt now just think about that in a nutshell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1159.8s	1159.8	 What was J Bhattacharya to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1161.9s	1161.9	 Maybe he was supposed to go on tick-tock and try to sound the alarm bells through a tick-tock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1166.3s	1166.3	 Maybe he was supposed to go on YouTube and create a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1169.1s	1169.1	 Maybe he was supposed to go on Facebook and you know post into a Facebook group or do a newsfeed post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1176.4s	1176.4	 The the problem is that and the odds are reasonably likely that a lot of these companies had very similar policies in this example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1183.9s	1183.9	 around kovat misinformation because it was the CDC and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1188.4s	1188.4	 You know governmental organizations directing, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1192.3s	1192.3	 information and rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1194.4s	1194.4	 Reaching out to all of these companies, right? So we're just seeing an insight into Twitter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1198.2s	1198.2	 But the point is it happened everywhere the implication of suppressing information like this is that a credible individual like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1206.4s	1206.4	 can't spark a public debate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1209.6s	1209.6	 In not being able to spark the debate you have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1214.7s	1214.7	 Building up of errors in the system and then who gets hurt in this example, which is true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1220.6s	1220.6	 It's like you couldn't even talk about school closures and masking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1224.8s	1224.8	 Upfront and early in the system if you had scientists actually debate it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1229.5s	1229.5	 maybe what would have happened is we would have kept the schools open and you would have had less learning loss and you'd have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1234.2s	1234.2	 less depression and less over prescription of you know, riddle in an adderall because those are all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1239.6s	1239.6	 Factual things we can measure today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1241.2s	1241.2	 So I think the important thing to take away from all of this is we've got confirmatory evidence that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1247.7s	1247.7	 Whether they're you know, these folks under a tidal wave of pressure made some really bad decisions and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1255.2s	1255.2	 the implications are pretty broad-reaching and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1258.5s	1258.5	 Now I do think governments have to step in and create better guardrails. So this kind of stuff doesn't happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1264.7s	1264.7	 I don't buy the whole it's a you know private company. They can do what they want. I think that that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1271.1s	1271.1	 Too naive of an expectation for how important these three companies literally are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1277.7s	1277.7	 to how Americans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1279.6s	1279.6	 Consume and process information to make decisions incredibly well said satch your reaction to your besties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1284.9s	1284.9	 I largely agree with what Chema said, but let's go back to what freeberg sex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1288.1s	1288.1	 I think what freeberg's point of view is is really what you're hearing now from the mainstream media today, which is oh nothing to see here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1295.0s	1295.0	 You know that they told us all along what was happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1298.3s	1298.3	 This was just content moderation. They had the right to do this. You're making a big deal over nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1303.2s	1303.2	 No, that's not true. Go back and look at the media coverage starting in 2018
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1307.5s	1307.5	 Article after article said that this idea of shadow banning was a right-wing conspiracy theory. That's what they said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1314.3s	1314.3	 Furthermore Jack Dorsey denied that shadow banning was happening including at a congressional hearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1319.5s	1319.5	 I believe under oath so either he lied or he was lied to by his subordinates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1324.9s	1324.9	 I actually believe that the latter is possible. I think I don't think it's true with SPF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1329.4s	1329.4	 It might be true with Jack because he is so checked out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1331.9s	1331.9	 Furthermore you had people again like Vigia Gotti
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1335.1s	1335.1	 Again tweeting and repeatedly stating we do not shadow ban
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1338.9s	1338.9	 We certainly don't shadow ban on the basis of political viewpoint. So these people were denying exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1345.1s	1345.1	 What their critics were saying they were accusing their critics of being conspiracy theorists now that the thing is proven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1351.8s	1351.8	 The mountain of evidence has dropped they're saying oh, well, this is old news. This was known a long time ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1356.8s	1356.8	 No, it was not known a long time ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1358.5s	1358.5	 It was disputed by you and now finally it's proven and you're trying to say it's not a big deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1364.6s	1364.6	 It is a big deal. It's a violation of the public trust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1367.8s	1367.8	 And if you were so proud of your content moderation policies, why didn't you admit what you were doing in the first place?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1375.2s	1375.2	 It's like you feel good that you want running this business now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1379.4s	1379.4	 The things that you're concerned about as a user as someone who cares about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1384.4s	1384.4	 The public's access to knowledge to opinions to free speech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1390.0s	1390.0	 This has got to be a good change right like this has come to light. It's clearly gonna get resolved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1394.8s	1394.8	 Everyone's gonna move forward. I mean do you think that there's penalties needed for the people that work there or like what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1399.2s	1399.2	 What's the anger cuz cuz no one like like I think I look I think we got I think we basically got extremely lucky
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1406.0s	1406.0	 Yeah, that Elon Musk happened to care about free speech and decided to do something about it and actually had the means to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1412.6s	1412.6	 Right. He's just about the only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1415.0s	1415.0	 Billionaire who has that level of means who actually cared enough to take on this battle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1420.5s	1420.5	 but I think that this is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1422.0s	1422.0	 I think you deserve praise for that but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1426.2s	1426.2	 Mean unless Elon can buy every single tech company, which he clearly can't I think you guys are right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1431.8s	1431.8	 A lot of other tech we're about to rewrite the government the United States government is going to make an attempt to rewrite section 230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1439.5s	1439.5	 I think that what this does is put a very fine point on a comment that Elon actually tweeted out and Nick if you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1446.8s	1446.8	 Find that please that's a very good tweet where he said going forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1449.9s	1449.9	 You will be able to see if you were shadow banned you were able to see if you were deep boosted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1456.1s	1456.1	 Why and be able to appeal and I think that that concept?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1460.6s	1460.6	 To be very honest with you should be enshrined in law
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1463.6s	1463.6	 and I think that should be part of the section 230 rewrite and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1468.3s	1468.3	 all of these media companies and all of these social media companies should be subject to it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1474.2s	1474.2	 The reason is because it ties a lot of these concepts together and says look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1479.2s	1479.2	 You can build a service. You're a private company make as much money as you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1483.5s	1483.5	 But we're going to have some connective tissue back to the fundamental underpinnings of the Constitution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1489.6s	1489.6	 Which is the framework under which we all live and we're gonna transparently allow you to understand it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1494.7s	1494.7	 I think that's really reasonable make that a legal expectation of all these organizations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1499.7s	1499.7	 And by the way, it's by the way, sorry the companies the companies will love it because I think it's super hard for you to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1505.9s	1505.9	 In these companies and they probably are like take this responsibility off my plate. It's very simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1510.8s	1510.8	 This is a there's really four problems that occurred here. Number one. There was no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1516.6s	1516.6	 Transparency the people who were shadow banned taken out of search, etc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1522.1s	1522.1	 They did not know if they were told and it was clear to users
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1527.0s	1527.0	 We could have a discussion about was that a fair judgment or not in the cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1531.2s	1531.2	 We've seen so far from Barry Weiss's reporting in the Twitter files part. Duh

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1756.4s	1756.4	 Maybe hey Fauci go talk to Jay because he's a Stanford prof. He's probably not an idiot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1761.0s	1761.0	 Why does he think that or maybe let's convene you know an actual group of 20 or 30 scientists and the fact that this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1769.7s	1769.7	 Version of thinking about things was deemed so heterodoxical. It is just such a good example

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1782.3s	1782.3	 So we know what happened by suppressing that speech and that's one example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1786.8s	1786.8	 Well, it's in my in my estimation it is the silver bullet example that cleans through all of this other stuff because you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1793.1s	1793.1	 I don't really care if Rachel Maddow as your client who the hell cares

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1904.2s	1904.2	 I think by the way, just so just a quick correction there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1906.1s	1906.1	 I think sacks when you said the post Washington Post Watergate spotlight exactly. I'm not thinking about spotlight. Sorry. It was maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1913.6s	1913.6	 Okay, but like but the post is another example that that movie was about another event like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1918.9s	1918.9	 Which could have been easily suppressed in today's world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1921.5s	1921.5	 Much harder there which was a Pentagon Papers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1924.0s	1924.0	 And in that world, you know, there was an immense amount of pressure that the government put on the Washington Post
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1930.1s	1930.1	 But then they said you know what we're going with it and they still published it and it created a groundswell of support to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1935.5s	1935.5	 Re-examine the Vietnam War and it had a huge impact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1938.0s	1938.0	 But could you imagine this time around which is like hey guys, there's gonna be some kind of misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1942.2s	1942.2	 You know, these Pentagon Papers are not real. It's it's coming from the Russians suppress it and nobody could think so much easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1949.2s	1949.2	 To run this play what journalists need to realize is that today's conspiracy theories are tomorrow's Pulitzer prizes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1968.1s	1968.1	 They are but what they need to do is thinking short term and think long term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1972.5s	1972.5	 Anytime there's a conspiracy theory you must give it some validity and say is there any truth here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1979.1s	1979.1	 Because it could in fact be a scandal that's being covered up

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=1995.0s	1995.0	 What he did was confirm that a completely true story by the New York Post about Hunter Biden that came out a month before the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2001.9s	2001.9	 was suppressed by Twitter executives including at the behest of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2010.4s	2010.4	 Former security state officials. So this has now been exposed. There was no legitimate basis for suppressing that story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2017.7s	2017.7	 It was true. It was a respective publication. They did it anyway. This is election interference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2023.3s	2023.3	 You know the same people who pride themselves on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2033.8s	2033.8	 Including of true stories before an election and then they puff out their chest and say we're protecting democracy. They're not protecting democracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2040.5s	2040.5	 They're interfering with democracy. They're interfering with the public's right to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2045.0s	2045.0	 And then we look at a country like china and we say we're so much better than them because they've got this problem over there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2050.5s	2050.5	 Where the state and big tech are colluding to create a big brother like system. Well, what is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2057.2s	2057.2	 What are these tools that have been exposed? This is a big brother like system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2061.6s	2061.6	 Okay. Yeah, but just you have to I know you want to make it like an equivalency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2065.8s	2065.8	 It's less than a one percent equivalency because in our society we can have moments like this and we can have investigations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2071.7s	2071.7	 So just to put it in perspective. Yeah, I don't look at jake. I don't think we're equivalent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2075.3s	2075.3	 But what i'm saying is that this is very much like a big brother social credit system. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2082.1s	2082.1	 Alarm bells should be going off

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2089.7s	2089.7	 Idiosyncratic billionaire who believes in free speech if he didn't decide to take this on we would never have known this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2095.8s	2095.8	 Okay, tell me what happened in between these two things. There is an attorney

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2110.9s	2110.9	 But there was in between these two drops something that happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2114.5s	2114.5	 Yes, so basically what was discovered and this is all just publicly reported is that a former fbi lawyer named jim baker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2122.3s	2122.3	 Had now become deputy general counsel

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2127.3s	2127.3	 And this guy jim baker is like the zealot of the whole russian collusion hoax. He was involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2132.5s	2132.5	 in the um in the fisa warrants that were that the fbi applied to the fisa courts that had all the errors and omissions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2140.2s	2140.2	 He was involved in the alphabank hoax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2142.4s	2142.4	 He was the guy that that perkins

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2151.8s	2151.8	 And he I don't think he was officially sanctioned, but basically he was asked to leave the fbi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2157.3s	2157.3	 And then lo and behold

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2162.1s	2162.1	 And he is involved in their content moderation policies. I think what it shows is how deeply intertwined
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2168.9s	2168.9	 Our big tech companies have become with the security state

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2176.1s	2176.1	 Barry weiss was basically uh putting forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2179.7s	2179.7	 Document requests for this for the latest batch of twitter files and she wasn't getting anything back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2185.3s	2185.3	 And she's like what's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2187.3s	2187.3	 And the guy who's giving her the files is his name is jim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2190.6s	2190.6	 And she's like, well wait like wait jim jim who and she finds out wait jim baker wait that jim baker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2197.0s	2197.0	 That you know new york post had a long story about this guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2200.3s	2200.3	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2201.3s	2201.3	 So it was discovered that the guy who was curating the twitter files
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2206.5s	2206.5	 Was this former operative of the fbi who was involved in the russian collusion hoax and then was involved in their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2215.2s	2215.2	 Their blacklist decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2217.6s	2217.6	 So in any event once this came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2221.1s	2221.1	 Twitter fired him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2222.9s	2222.9	 and then you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2224.9s	2224.9	 Barry apparently received all these files that are now the the second batch of the twitter files and just to be clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2230.1s	2230.1	 That's not james baker if you're you know thinking it's the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2238.3s	2238.3	 This is jim baker who's a different person right? But a lot of people are wondering. Well, how could this have been missed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2243.1s	2243.1	 Listen, he's an fbi ex-fbi. These guys don't want to be found. I mean they they this is some people call it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2255.0s	2255.0	 The people who work in washington stay there forever and they can simply effectuate policy by outlasting everybody else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2261.9s	2261.9	 And clandestinely implementing what they believe and they've become a constituency of their own that exercises power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2269.3s	2269.3	 Like a pritorian guard in washington. So in any event, this guy is an expert at bowl weeviling himself into the bureaucracy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2301.0s	2301.0	 Like burrows like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2303.1s	2303.1	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2305.1s	2305.1	 Oh, he he digs his way into the twitter bureaucracy to the point where he isn't even found and then somehow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2311.6s	2311.6	 He has put himself in the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2313.9s	2313.9	 To be intermediating the twitter files. Can you believe this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2319.1s	2319.1	 So once it was discovered a unit of the imperio roman army that served as personal party guards and intelligence agents the pritorian guard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2326.6s	2326.6	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2326.9s	2326.9	 Got it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2327.3s	2327.3	 Well, you understand what happened is is that the pritorian guard originated because they were to defend the life of the emperor and then what happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2334.6s	2334.6	 that then they became so powerful that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2337.4s	2337.4	 Uh that whoever bribed the pritorians would become emperor and then finally the last step is that the pritorians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2343.6s	2343.6	 Themselves would pick the emperor and whoever basically led the pritorian guard would be the next emperor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2349.6s	2349.6	 In any event, I mean we're not we're not at that point yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2352.5s	2352.5	 But the point is look the point is that these security state officials have power that they should not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2359.7s	2359.7	 Okay, that's the bottom line. They should not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2362.9s	2362.9	 Involved in our elections in this way. They should be completely non-partisan and non-political
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2369.6s	2369.6	 They should just do their jobs as law enforcement officials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2372.3s	2372.3	 But we know from the hunter biden story that a very important piece of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2376.9s	2376.9	 Was the pre-bunking that the fbi went to facebook and twitter and social networks and said be on the lookout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2383.5s	2383.5	 For a story about hunter biden it is russian disinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2387.2s	2387.2	 And they primed these social networks to suppress that story when it came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2391.3s	2391.3	 That was something they never should have done and they knew they knew the story was not fake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2395.3s	2395.3	 The new is not russian disinformation because they had the laptop in their possession since 2019

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2409.1s	2409.1	 You also have to put the context in here and please let me finish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2412.9s	2412.9	 There is a context here of there was massive election

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2424.1s	2424.1	 And trump's encouraging the ukraine and the republicans the russians to interfere in elections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2429.5s	2429.5	 Everybody was on high alert and that happened to drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2432.7s	2432.7	 Uh, like it was announced 30 days before and it dropped 10 days before the election
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2435.9s	2435.9	 So everybody was on high alert and I agree. It was not done properly. That's why it was the perfect

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2483.7s	2483.7	 Nobody questions that in fact the fbi has admitted that the laptop was real and that the the hunter buying files are real

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2915.8s	2915.8	 Wrote a letter that essentially said, you know, if we don't figure out a way to get out of these pandas this this lockdown process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2922.1s	2922.1	 We're going to lose. Um, you know our leadership in the global supply chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2927.5s	2927.5	 And apparently that jolted the central planning commission to realize that they needed to you know, get out of these lockdowns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2933.8s	2933.8	 I think it's something different which is I think this has been part and parcel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2938.4s	2938.4	 of a very focused and dedicated plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2942.5s	2942.5	 baiji
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2943.8s	2943.8	 Phase one was to consolidate power phase two was to get through november
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2949.4s	2949.4	 And to basically get reappointed for life and dispel any other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2954.2s	2954.2	 You know rivals that he actually had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2957.5s	2957.5	 And now phase three is just to reopen the economy again. So this guy can basically sit on top of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2964.0s	2964.0	 The second largest economy in the world, so I think this is sort of a natural uh flow of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2970.1s	2970.1	 The other part of it, which I think is being under reported
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2973.1s	2973.1	 Is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2974.2s	2974.2	 I think that the way in which they did it was less responsive in my opinion to a letter from uncle terry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2979.7s	2979.7	 But was more responsive to the fact that there are people on the ground and I think that these guys are getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2984.6s	2984.6	 very sophisticated and understanding how to give the chinese people some part of what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2991.4s	2991.4	 So that they're roughly happy enough to keep moving forward and i'm not going to morally judge whether it's right or wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=2996.6s	2996.6	 But it's just a comment on what the gameplay and the game theory seems to be coming from the leadership of china
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3003.4s	3003.4	 So it's just I think this is it's it's it's good for the chinese people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3008.0s	3008.0	 And the real question is what will it mean for the u.s. Economy if these guys get their um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3013.5s	3013.5	 get their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3014.6s	3014.6	 economy going again, we talked about this previously, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3017.6s	3017.6	 This is a good example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3019.7s	3019.7	 of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3021.1s	3021.1	 autocrat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3022.2s	3022.2	 Not necessarily being absolute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3025.1s	3025.1	 uh in in their um authority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3028.2s	3028.2	 and the sense that I think we get at this point coming out of china
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3034.0s	3034.0	 Is that there was enough descent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3036.5s	3036.5	 From the populace on the lockdown and the experience of the lockdowns and we can all go online and see the videos of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3042.2s	3042.2	 Steel bars being put on doors to keep people in their apartment buildings and people screaming and buildings being on fire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3047.9s	3047.9	 People can't escape the buildings how much of that was true or not and and riots in the screen and people fighting with the covet testers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3054.8s	3054.8	 How much of it is true or not? We don't really know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3058.2s	3058.2	 But it certainly seems to indicate that there was enough descent and enough unrest that in order to stay in power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3064.4s	3064.4	 The ccp had to take action and they had to shift their position and shift their tone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3069.4s	3069.4	 And I think it's a really important moment to observe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3073.0s	3073.0	 that sometimes the ccp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3075.9s	3075.9	 and you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3077.3s	3077.3	 Perhaps even we can extend this into other autocratic regimes that we think are absolute in their authority and their power and their power
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3086.0s	3086.0	 perhaps are necessarily influenced by the people that they are there to govern and that they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3091.0s	3091.0	 You know ruling over and that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3094.6s	3094.6	 While we don't think about these places as democracies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3098.2s	3098.2	 Perhaps they're not entirely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3100.2s	3100.2	 the traditionally defined autocracy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3103.0s	3103.0	 That there is an influence that the people can have and maybe we see the same change happening in iran
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3109.1s	3109.1	 With young people and a population that's more modern that's growing and swelling in size that doesn't want to accept some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3116.5s	3116.5	 traditional norms and the traditional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3118.5s	3118.5	 Laws and you know, maybe that will kind of start to resonate around the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3122.6s	3122.6	 That the internet is starting to do what everyone hoped and wanted it to do which is the democratization of information the democratization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3129.9s	3129.9	 of seeing other people's conditions and seeing what the rest of the world is and is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3134.4s	3134.4	 gives the populace the ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3137.0s	3137.0	 To rise up and to say this is what we want because we know that there are better things out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3142.3s	3142.3	 And these autocratic regimes have to start to shift slightly and over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3146.1s	3146.1	 Here's a specific statistic and chart for everybody the demographics of iran are incredibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3154.0s	3154.0	 Notable if you look at this chart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3157.1s	3157.1	 For those of you listening it just shows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3159.4s	3159.4	 People by age and how many what percentage of the population they are or actually the wrong numbers of the population as you can see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3165.9s	3165.9	 It's basically like a pair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3167.5s	3167.5	 You have very few old people and you have a lot of people in their 20s and younger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3172.0s	3172.0	 And so young people no no no jason it's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3175.8s	3175.8	 40s and 30s is really okay. So 40s 30s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3179.9s	3179.9	 You don't have the geriatric population that you see in other countries like japan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3184.9s	3184.9	 And so the demographics of iran are extremely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3188.8s	3188.8	 weighted towards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3190.5s	3190.5	 younger people millennials gen xers and younger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3194.5s	3194.5	 And they have vpns virtual private networks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3197.0s	3197.0	 They can see everything happening in the world and they can see the world in a different way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3201.5s	3201.5	 Everything happening in the free world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3206.0s	3206.0	 Versus let's say closed societies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3208.0s	3208.0	 And so I think that's what gives me a lot of hope is that these countries are going to have to evolve because young people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3213.1s	3213.1	 Are seeing how the rest of the world lives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3216.2s	3216.2	 And I think that's a big part of the change tomoth. What are your thoughts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3220.6s	3220.6	 About iran specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3222.6s	3222.6	 I think demographic change and then china and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3225.8s	3225.8	 demographic change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3228.4s	3228.4	 I've said this before and i've been tweeting about this for years, but people so poorly understand demographics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3233.3s	3233.3	 everybody thinks that we have a surplus of people and we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3236.9s	3236.9	 and we need to have a positive birth rate in order to kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3240.3s	3240.3	 Continue to support the expansion of the world and gdp and we need that and right now we're not in that situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3246.6s	3246.6	 If you look at a country by country basis a lot of these countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3249.9s	3249.9	 um are facing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3252.3s	3252.3	 in a pretty cataclysmic way the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3255.0s	3255.0	 Sensitive country to this is china. I mean their population get current course and speed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3261.0s	3261.0	 I think the last number is it's going to have by 2100. There'll be about 600 million people in china
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3267.4s	3267.4	 Which is unbelievably disruptive in a very negative way for them, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3271.7s	3271.7	 Because you will have a lot of people who are entering the workforce having to support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3277.5s	3277.5	 An entire cohort of people above them in terms of age, right who are retired, etc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3281.7s	3281.7	 So the state's going to have to get much much more actively involved over the next 50 years in china
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3287.6s	3287.6	 And then you look at other countries like nigeria or india who are in uh, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3292.9s	3292.9	 At the beginning of what could be a multi-decade boom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3296.3s	3296.3	 Because you have 20 year olds that will be entering the workforce, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3299.9s	3299.9	 They'll effectively work for less than their older counterparts, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3303.0s	3303.0	 So then there'll be an incentive then to bring work on shore into those countries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3307.8s	3307.8	 And so it's going to have huge impacts because then you have rising gdp you'll have rising expectations of living quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3315.4s	3315.4	 You'll have rising expectations of how governments treat those people. So it's all kind of positive in general, but the world needs more people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3323.7s	3323.7	 Let's just be clear, especially in western countries. We are going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3328.2s	3328.2	 Not we're not as badly off as china, but we're not far behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3331.3s	3331.3	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3331.4s	3331.4	 Here's a quick view of china and japan if you're just you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3334.2s	3334.2	 These same kind of I don't know what they exactly call these charts are kind of like vertical histograms, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3339.4s	3339.4	 You start and again, you know data is hard to come by in some countries, but you know china's starting to get top heavy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3346.0s	3346.0	 When compared to iran and then if you look at japan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3349.2s	3349.2	 Quite stunning. There's just no young people left and uh, they live very uh to much older ages in japan

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3587.7s	3587.7	 If you're a defense attorney that represents someone that you know is guilty

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3599.7s	3599.7	 I don't think there's only the murder of my money in this case. Okay, it's it's murder of of ftx's money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3605.4s	3605.4	 In my view everybody's look joe

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3624.9s	3624.9	 I you know, you can make that decision on your own, but i'm going to this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3629.1s	3629.1	 If you want to say he's guilty before he's tried. I just don't understand it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3633.4s	3633.4	 It may end up costing you 15 for reputation on everything else. That's the problem. That's why I stay on this pursuit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3639.4s	3639.4	 I'm very transparent about it. I've disclosed everything I know about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3642.1s	3642.1	 I will find out more information if I make the credit committee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3644.8s	3644.8	 I will act as a fiduciary for everybody involved. I will testify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3648.5s	3648.5	 I am an advocate for this industry and this changes nothing just look at the numbers that came out of circle today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3654.5s	3654.5	 I'm an investor there, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3655.8s	3655.8	 You've got the I lost it all in ftx and we have a fantastic print on circle the promise of crypto remains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3662.5s	3662.5	 This will not change it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3664.5s	3664.5	 Pretty crazy 15 million bucks any thoughts on the continuing sbf saga sax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3669.8s	3669.8	 Well, I don't know why we should care so much about him. I mean kevin leero, but um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3675.5s	3675.5	 But look, I think it's indicative of all these guys that got money from this guy. Who is he? Who is he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3682.1s	3682.1	 He's one of what he's on shark tank and he's a contributor to cnbc who's on multiple times a week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3687.7s	3687.7	 The point is like you've got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3690.4s	3690.4	 The grift i'm just trying to point out 15 million dollars to a cnbc commentator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3695.9s	3695.9	 Is just an extraordinary payoff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3698.7s	3698.7	 I've never heard of anything like that. I don't I don't think it's fair to pick on kevin o'leary per se
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3704.4s	3704.4	 Because there is a bunch of those guys that took money from him, you know a bunch of athletes did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3709.7s	3709.7	 Probably a bunch of movie stars pacts, you know republicans democrats. Yeah, like everybody got paid by this guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3717.8s	3717.8	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3719.2s	3719.2	 Just like in the twitter example, I think it's important in this case to generalize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3723.9s	3723.9	 Because the generalized thing is the real problem look if you want to focus on the crux of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3729.3s	3729.3	 You have a concept in law that sax knows better than the rest of us called fraudulent conveyance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3734.3s	3734.3	 And we have example after example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3737.1s	3737.1	 Where it does not matter whether it was in the bernie madeoff example or for example, jason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3741.5s	3741.5	 We talked about it the guy in la that lost all the money client funds playing poker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3746.5s	3746.5	 Yep, you have to give the money back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3748.8s	3748.8	 Especially if it was fraudulently conveyed to you explain can you explain this in detail for a second?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3753.8s	3753.8	 So the audience understands well on my understanding which is very basic and I think david can probably do a much better job is the following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3760.0s	3760.0	 Which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3761.2s	3761.2	 If you get money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3763.5s	3763.5	 some way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3765.1s	3765.1	 But it comes from somebody who fraudulently acquired that money you have to give the money back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3771.8s	3771.8	 So in this example what it would mean is if that they can show that that 15 million dollars that this guy got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3779.5s	3779.5	 Came from sbf basically raiding the piggy bank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3784.1s	3784.1	 of user accounts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3786.7s	3786.7	 He's gonna have to pay the money back just like for example in the made-off fraud
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3792.0s	3792.0	 the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3793.6s	3793.6	 The the folks that went to find the money were able to go back to folks that actually redeemed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3798.5s	3798.5	 Even the beginning early ones and said I understand that you didn't know any better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3801.7s	3801.7	 But this was fraudulently conveyed to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3803.9s	3803.9	 So we need the money back and they got the money back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3806.6s	3806.6	 In that case if they had put a million in and it grew to three million
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3809.7s	3809.7	 They got their million principal back, but the two million in gains which were ill-gotten had to be returned returned returned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3816.5s	3816.5	 As I understand it based on just what i've read that there's a 90-day rule around contributions meaning that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=3822.8s	3822.8	 If I think this has to do with the bankruptcy that that if he donated money within 90 days

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4083.3s	4083.3	 formerly democrat now independent who is in the mold of you know, john mccain who was a former senator from arizona
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4090.1s	4090.1	 Sort of this maverick independent and she does not count out to her party orthodoxy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4095.1s	4095.1	 and when biden

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4102.2s	4102.2	 She along with mansion opposed it and I think saved the administration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4106.4s	4106.4	 From this gigantic boondoggle that would have been inflation much much worse now mansion got all the credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4111.0s	4111.0	 But she was equally responsible for putting a hold on that and then as a result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4115.8s	4115.8	 They only did the 750 billion inflation reduction act. So she's willing to buck her own party now as a result of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4122.6s	4122.6	 I think they were planning on she was going to get primaried that the progressive wing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4127.2s	4127.2	 Of the party was planning on primaring her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4129.9s	4129.9	 And by moving to an independent in a sense, she preempts that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4134.4s	4134.4	 Because what she's now saying is she's now sort of like, you know, uh bernie sanders is an independent or this guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4141.1s	4141.1	 Uh angus king from from maine. They still caucus with the democrats, but they're independents and the and the democrats don't run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4149.8s	4149.8	 Uh candidates against them because they know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4152.8s	4152.8	 That if they do you'll have a republican a democrat and independent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4157.1s	4157.1	 And the democrats and the independents will split the vote and the republican will win. So basically she's now daring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4163.0s	4163.0	 The democrats. Hey, if you want to run a candidate against me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4166.4s	4166.4	 I'm not going to sit around and get primaried by them you go ahead and run somebody but then we're both going to lose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4172.1s	4172.1	 I like to they're a republican. That's what's smart about it is I think she's daring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4176.7s	4176.7	 Schumer to run somebody against her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4179.5s	4179.5	 It's also interesting. She's she's the only member of congress i've read that's non-theist, which is kind of like atheist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4186.4s	4186.4	 She doesn't talk about god or doesn't believe in god and I think she's the first openly bisexual member of congress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4192.4s	4192.4	 She's a maverick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4195.0s	4195.0	 Certainly sax do you think she held up on making this decision until after that georgia senate runoff election finished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4201.4s	4201.4	 And do you think that it influenced the decision? I don't know, but I I think that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4206.0s	4206.0	 Consideration here for her is yeah. Well, imagine if she doesn't make this move now, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4211.8s	4211.8	 And then in two years, well, I guess really next year she gets primaried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4215.8s	4215.8	 Okay, and then what if she loses the primary it's going to be very hard for her to run as an independent at that point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4221.5s	4221.5	 It'll look like sour grapes sore loser, right? But if she goes independent now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4228.6s	4228.6	 She's saying listen, I'm running as an independent no matter what the question you have to make is what the democratic party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4234.8s	4234.8	 Is whether to support me or basically tank this election and throw it will we see more of this purple approach?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4241.4s	4241.4	 I was just going to ask you what does this mean for joe mansion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4245.3s	4245.3	 Well, I don't think joe mansion has this problem and i'll tell you why because um,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4249.0s	4249.0	 West virginia unlike arizona is like a plus 22 red state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4253.2s	4253.2	 Joe mansion is the only politician in that state who could win that seat for the democrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4259.4s	4259.4	 When joe mansion retires that seat is going republican
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4262.9s	4262.9	 And schumer knows this the democrats know this they think they're lucky stars every day that they got joe mansion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HBFo7ft9k&list=UUESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg&index=15&t=4268.6s	4268.6	 Because otherwise that would be a republican seat
